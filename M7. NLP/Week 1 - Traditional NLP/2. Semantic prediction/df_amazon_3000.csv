0.3."more like funchuck Gave this to my dad for a gag gift after directing ""Nunsense,"" he got a reall kick out of it!"
1.5."Inspiring I hope a lot of people hear this cd. We need more strong and positive vibes like this. Great vocals, fresh tunes, cross-cultural happiness. Her blues is from the gut. The pop sounds are catchy and mature."
2.5."The best soundtrack ever to anything. I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny."
3.4."Chrono Cross OST The music of Yasunori Misuda is without question my close second below the great Nobuo Uematsu.Chrono Cross OST is a wonderful creation filled with rich orchestra and synthesized sounds. While ambiance is one of the music's major factors, yet at times it's very uplifting and vigorous. Some of my favourite tracks include; ""Scars Left by Time, The Girl who Stole the Stars, and Another World""."
4.5.Too good to be true Probably the greatest soundtrack in history! Usually it's better to have played the game first but this is so enjoyable anyway! I worked so hard getting this soundtrack and after spending [money] to get it it was really worth every penny!! Get this OST! it's amazing! The first few tracks will have you dancing around with delight (especially Scars Left by Time)!! BUY IT NOW!!
5.5."There's a reason for the price There's a reason this CD is so expensive, even the version that's not an import.Some of the best music ever. I could listen to every track every minute of every day. That's about all i can say."
6.1."Buyer beware This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
7.4."Errors, but great story I was a dissapointed to see errors on the back cover, but since I paid for the book I read it anyway. I have to say I love it. I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in two hours. I say buy it. I say read it. It is sad, but it gives an interesting point of view on church today. We spend too much time looking at the faults of others. I also enjoyed beloved.Sincerly,Jaylynn R"
8.1."The Worst! A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
9.1."Oh please I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
10.1."Awful beyond belief! I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
11.4."A romantic zen baseball comedy When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA"". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!"
12.5."Lower leg comfort for 12 hours + Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight, not too loose...garment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care)."
13.3."Delivery was very long wait..... It took almost 3 weeks to recieve the two pairs of stockings I ordered and when they arrived they were not in a box nor did they have any tags on them so I am not certain they are actually Jobst brand stockings. The Sun Bronze pair fits okay but quality is less than the pair I bought at an actual compression store."
14.2."sizes recomended in the size chart are not real sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it"
15.3."Overbury Full of intrigue and a good overview of the court of James 1 and the key players. Provides a good general history of all the facts of the case."
16.1."Another Abysmal Digital Copy Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon."
17.4."Wardell's book is a pure delight. Steven Wardell's book is a pure delight and I've recommended itto friends of all ages. In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's ""Generation X"". Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of ""Western culture"" - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values. The Ando family members are wonderful, memorable people and Stevern Wardell writes poignantly about their lives and hopes of each of them."
18.4."i liked this album more then i thought i would I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days."
19.3."Better than I thought. I wrote a harsh review based on hearing a couple of tracks from one album,but after hearing tracks from the other 3 albums,I have to say that I take it back and in fact I bought it.The other albums are very good value for money with good liner notes and some very good music.Well worth the money for Roy Orbison fans."
20.3."The great Roy Orbison deserves a better quality recording . When I saw the term 'bootleg' on the title of this recording,I can see what they mean because one cd does have a slightly disappointing sound,but the others do sound much better.Having seen the great Roy Orbison twice live in concert,I know that he sounded better,but overall it is a good value for money 4cd set with good liner notes."
21.2."Problem with charging smaller AAAs I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."
22.5."CHECK OUT THE K6000 CHARGER! Greetings. Kodak also has a K6000 charger which comes with 4 NiMH 2100 mAh batteries. Two batteries charge is 64 minutes and 4 batteries charge in 140 minutes. The problem is that Amazon doesn't carry them YET. Good bye."
23.5."ahhh These will more than pay for themselves, they are perfect for my GPS which will drain a cheap battery in less than an hour.btw the charger did come with 1850 batteries."
24.5."Excellent Product This is an excellent product. I bought this for my digital camera. It has a great battery life per charge. Charger is handy to carry."
25.1."Batteries died within a year ... I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power."
26.5."To ""Disappointed"" in Miami You said ""...but the charge only lasts a very short time.""Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised."
27.5."Awesome - wanna use dramatica? You definitely need this book It's just awesome, even better than what you can read online about using dramatica of Armando. If you want to use Dramatica - and don't want to get lost eventually - you really, really, really need this guide to get to some point you can call your plot really a plot. This book just makes you very, very happy. For it will boost your efforts to really WORK with dramatica. I only wish we had had that book ten years before. So I do highly recommend it. Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy. Thank you so much, Armando. Greetings from Germany, Cologne"
28.4."Excellent choice for combination After reading several reviews on this item, I purchased it as a Christmas gift. My brother liked it a lot, so I decided to get one for my wife and me. I'm really glad I did. It's pretty easy to set up and use, and the playback is excellent in both the VCR and DVD modes. The remote also operates my JVC TV. This is a great choice if you're looking for a quality combination player from a trusted name in electronics."
29.4."Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did! This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
30.3."Good player but wish I could change a few things Overall, this player works great and was fairly easy to set up. However, the display is ugly (orange lettering that reminds me of my alarm clock) and only displays minutes, not seconds. Also, the lack of universal remote is a drawback. Finally, I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP (2 hr) or EP (6 hour) speeds. Maybe this is standard now, but I've always liked LP mode for taping movies so you could fit two on a tape. This stuff may seem trivial. Anyway, that's my two cents."
31.2."DVD Player crapped out after one year I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot."
32.5."Very Happy - Has ""Random"" capability for MP3s I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select ""random"" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality."
33.3."Great DVD, mediocre VCR This is a fine unit for DVD playback, and has a lot of great features. But my experience with the VCR side left a lot to be desired. The machine has been saddled with a sub-par tuner which makes for noisy, color smeared VHS recordings, and its playback of factory pre-records isn't all that great either (but I will say that EP recordings don't fall off very much quality wise from SP, although the frequency response at both speeds is pretty atrocious). JVC brags about how it's the inventor of VHS. . . shame they couldn't do better here."
34.5."This is a very good book for students and engineers. Many useful concepts of digital compression can be found in this book. It is easy to read and understand, especially for students and engineers in EE."
35.3."Comprehensive but marred by poor printing This book appears to be a ""print on demand"" style book which manifests itself, in this case, as a poor quality hardcover. Some of the text is laughably bad, the few images near the end look like they are snapshots from a black and white TV screen, but most bothersome is the ""muddy"" look of the text. The price seems a bit steep for such a poor quality print. That said, the actual content is very comprehensive. One of the authors (Gray) is co-creator of the now commonplace LBG (Linde Buzo Gray) VQ algorithm. Fortunately, the quality of the content shines through the terrible printing."
36.5."Great reference book for its topic It seems somebody was complaining for the printing quality. This is not a calculus book. If you take most theoretical books, and certainly most Springer's book, they don't have nice full color Barney images. This is technical (mostly theoretical) stuff. There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field."
37.4."large volume,not enough proof, introductory, good organizati It seems that authors have pictures unrelated to content of the text repeatedly printed. It does not cover major topics, such as .gif/ graphic file compression. On the positive side it is well-written, organized, multiple equation in some chapters, descriptive in others. Very little mathematical proof."
38.1."should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle"" The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
39.5."Here is a little secret. After you watch a few episodes, it will be fairly clear to you who the two central characters are. If you enjoy a fitting but bleak ending, stop at Season 3, Episode 5. But if you prefer romantic comedies, view through 3/5 then skip to Season 4, Episode 3, as the final act."
40.3."A Good Show, But I'm Kind of Annoyed. . . I love this show, however, there are 14 episodes in the first season and this DVD only shows the first eight. This is kind of annoying as the best episodes happen towards the end of the season. I hope the BBC will release another DVD that contains all the episodes, but for now this one is still somewhat enjoyable."
41.2."Not an ""ultimate guide"" Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you."
42.4."It works What can I say? It works. This helped me when applying to law schools. A great guide to utilize. Cutting a great score on the LSAT is just part of the equation to get into law school."
43.1.Nothing you don't already know If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!
44.3."Door hanger review This looked like a great project for the kids and very cute and attractive. The markers did not write on the hanger without wiping off and this was disappointing to the kids. Great idea and set, just need markers that work for it."
45.5."Rochelle explains It All for You Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
46.5."Spreading a Passion for God Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious. I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time. Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire time.I don't really care for the youth interviews, but I understand given the format of the original presentation. I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussions.I'd recommend to anybody. The humility and genuine concern of Piper toward his audience is refreshing against some of the other more famous ""christian leaders"" today."
47.1."Doesn't work on a Mac It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!"
48.5.supermarionation attack! if you love thunderbirds or any of anderson's productions,you will love this cd! a collection of songs from and inspired from his fab shows from the 60's thru today long live gerry!
49.3."Good for what it is As a recipe book, this isn't all that great. The waffles are pretty good and the biscuits are enjoyable (especially with some whole wheat flour mixed in), but overall there aren't that many recipes.I enjoyed the writing style and anecdotes, but I was hoping for more recipes.On the positive side, the author does not make the reader feel that using sourdough is difficult or mysterious, but makes it attainable for the novice."
50.4."Alaska Sourdough Book Reivew We purchased this book based on a recommendation to create our own sourdough ""start"". The book is detailed and very informative. We have enjoyed creating our own sourdough start. It is amazing that you should leave the sourdough start on the counter for up to a year to have a stronger flavor."
51.2."Maybe I got a bad one. My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it."
52.1."TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
53.2."*** BEWARE *** This TV is set so that it is not capable of a ""recall"" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying."
54.5."Excellent Service Recieved this item in very fast time. was perfectely happy with shipper and sylvania lcd tv is excellent buy and works perfect. would do business with shipper anytime."
55.5."Dk Travel guides The Dk Travel guides are the best travel guides produced, each one a high quality illustrated encyclopedia on the country or city it represents. They are invaluable guides. The only disadvantage is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but the quality of printing and extensive range of color photos offsets that."
56.4."nice eye candy, but not as handy as the other guides The Eyewitness Travel Guides in general provide lots of pretty pictures and are very nice, but if you want a handy, practical guide to TAKE WITH YOU on a trip you are much better off with the Rick Steves, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's series of travel guides. The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation. Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is. I recommend Rick Steves Best of Europe, or Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring if you want a more useful guide."
57.2."Not the best I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!"
58.3."If it's Tuesday it must be Belgium This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a ""buffet"" tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...)."
59.1."Not! If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated."
60.4."Modern Traditional Point of View The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string. The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes. Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters. But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures."
61.4."Book is great - Purchase misleading ! I have no quarrel with the book itself. Wanted a copy for a long time. However, I purchased a used book with the understanding that it was a ""Signed Copy."" The copy I received WAS NOT autographed. This is a disappointment. If you advertise it as an autographed copy, don't substitute one that isn't. Leaves me in serious doubt regarding furture purchases. I'd appreciate some clarification. Regards, Elmer Kurrus"
62.2."Disappointing The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
63.1."Very poor quality. The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid."
64.2."Scraped across the whole top. Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen."
65.2."Didn't live up to expectations. I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better."
66.5."creativity for everyone did you know this software has been arwarded for parents choice arward 2002 i try this software and it's1# creativity for girls to imspire art in time."
67.3."ADVENTURE NEEDS MORE!! I thought this was a good game. However it was really short, and that made it not as enjoyable as I was hoping it would have been.Overall is a good game but it needs a longer storyline to it!"
68.5."Wonderful Game Got the game for my daughter when she was four and she LOVES it. She finished it rather quickly and the games are not particularly difficult or educational, but she still occasionally likes to play it. It's a beautiful game. I wrote this review because the game froze on us as well. I had to update our video card driver and it has worked perfectly since. Hope this helps."
69.3."Probably Won't Become Your Favorite Barbie Game This Rapunzel game was not really my favorite game. It wasn't that much fun. You have to wait a long time to move to another place. And whenever you want to go someplace else you have to click arrows up and down. This game was not fun b/c when you click the arrows up and down it goes somewhere else you do not want it to be at. I would not recommend that you would buy this game. I would rather play princess fashion boutique."
70.4."very entertaining and worth the money I bought this software for my 5-year old daughter for Christmas. She and her twin sister, along with their 4-year old sister, LOVE this game!!! They love everything about it, from the theme song at the beginning, to finding Prince Stefan in the maze at the end. I will admit, it's not super educational, but it does keep them entertained and it's nice to have a ""fun"" game once in awhile that doesn't require them to think too hard! It's also nice because they can leave the game midway, and return back to where they left off by clicking on their name. The names can also be deleted so that they can start a fresh game. They can restore the castle over and over again and have it be different every time. I think it was totally worth the money."
71.3."Over all, an okay game My daughters have both enjoyed playing this game. One of them is 6 yrs. old and the other is 3 1/2 yrs. old. and they both have had no trouble mastering this game. The down side to this game is that it is redundant/repeatitive. It is the same things over and over again, only you can change the patterns and colors of the items you are working on. In order to be able to play again after you have completed it, you must go and remove their name from the sign-in page 'then' retype it! This little chore is very annoying after awhile. The graphics are very nice and colorful and it does allow your child to use her imagination and to be creative, but all in all , I think the game was way too pricey for what it is. After having this in our house for 4 months, my girls have become rather bored with it."
72.5."NYTimes Likes IT BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL: A CREATIVE ADVENTURE. I don't like Barbie, yet even with my negative attitude I appreciated the Barbie as Rapunzel adventure. This is a creative game in which the player must help Barbie free Prince Stefan from an evil spell by restoring a cursed and very run-down castle. The player takes Barbie around the castle and selects colors and patterns to decorate with magic paintbrushes and wands. Once each room is redecorated, Barbie retrieves a gem that will eventually be placed in the prince's crown to break the spell on him. The Barbie and Prince get to live in their renovated home - happily ever after, of course."
73.1."Bad Deal!! I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
74.3."doesn't last very light scent that doesn't last very long. pretty bottle but I was hoping for more of a freesia scent. which it was not."
75.2."audio options non existent While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock."
76.3."Have yet to watch it yet. I bought this movie to watch with my Thai girlfriend and did not get teh chance. She told me kn the phone she was watching it.She seemed to Enjoy it overall. When is howed this one and 1-2 to her she said its not for her. She lieks scary movies but this one did not apeal to her.Well she did watch it and enjoyed it. I wont get to watch it untill Aug. But i am looking forward to it.I gave the 3 star because i have not seen it. I would have givin it a 1 or a 2. It was moved to a three because of my girl friends opinon. First she said not for her than she said good movie. So it changed her mind.I am looking forward to it though"
77.5."Hamelin does it again I confess to being a Hamelin fanatic! To me, Marc-Andre Hamelin is the best pianist performing today and I anxiously await new recordings by him. The Brahms is one of the greatest concertos ever written and it's one of my favorites. Hamelin plays it supperbly and the orchestra, under Litton's leadership, provides exceptional support. This is a ""must have"" CD for anyone who loves great piano playing. The Hyperion sound is fabulous, as usual too."
78.4."Leap Frog Math Whiz Learning Bus Tray Puzzle This is an excellent learning tool. It starts with basic shapes, then numbers, and then addition and subtraction. All done in a simple puzzle format. Wonderful to use one on one with two to four year olds. The whole concept is very basic, but the skills are extremely necessary and this is a great start."
79.3."weak I had very high expectations for this book. Never having been to the national portrait gallery I wasn't sure what to expect but I thought it would be the pinnacle of portraiture. I was completely dissapointed to see the poor quality of work by well known and unknown artists alike.There are of course exceptions but they are few and far between. I gave it 3 stars because the text is excellent, it's well laid out and very fun to read."
80.1."It Drew Air This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book."
81.4."Good value in gym wear As is the case with most adidas products I've owned, my 3-stripe fleece pants are made for style, fit, and durability. They are just the right weight of fabric for those cool winter mornings in Southern California (not so for 85degree summer days, when I'll stash them away for cooler days to come). My size is somewhere between a medium and a large. These adidas pants are amply cut, but maybe a tad too roomy for my particular build. A medium would probably be restrictive when I'm doing calesthenics or some weight exercises. This being said, I am nevertheless very happy with this product and with Amazon's superior service."
82.1."Buyer Beware!! I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!"
83.4."Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?! I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their ""rock"" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their ""2 Many DJs"" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, ""Nite Versions"" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release ""Nite Version"" on 12"" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming ""Sexor"" debut...?"
84.5."super I just love this album. Soulwax is great but this house/rave mix is even better. Can't stop moving while you listen to it."
85.2."Slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie 2 stars of 5 for this slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie."
86.5."A Beautiful Map This map is clear and informative, but more than that, it is beautiful to look at.Ordering it from the UK, I would have liked a quicker delivery option. But it arrived more or less when they promised -- if anything, a week sooner than I expected.Thoroughly satisfied with this purchase."
87.3."Don't be confused by album cover Caution. This album cover is almost exactly like the album cover for Deodato In Concert, which has different songs on it (it seems both albums have Do it Again and Spirit of Summer). If you're looking for Also Sprach Zarathustra, buy the other In Concert album (or Prelude). This album has Deodato on side 1, Airto on side 2(and I'm talking about the vinyl version, which I just bought at a thrift shop. I'm not talking about the CD). Different bands on each side. As for the music...it's OK. I give it a 3 out of 5 stars. Can't beat thrift shop price of $1 for vinyl albums."
88.5."Karen Cummings, comes through. Wonderful! Karen Cummings writes a book that tells you all thebasics of cat care and tailors it to the Birman breed. The excellentphotographs enable the reader to see what a Birman really looks like. The history of the Birman, (Sacred cat of Burma), it's mythic legend is beautifully illustrated in the artworks that appear on page three and seven; ""Mandela Cat"" and ""Temple of the Sacred Cat"". I am the artist of these artworks and I am very impressed with the excellent reproductions produced by the publisher. In addition, as a Birman breeder for over 15 years I can and do highly recommend this book."
89.4."This one is one of my favorite's I really liked this one. I admit I had a little bit of a hard time getting into it a first. I have enjoyed all of the Avon true romance books, but the covers don't do much to promote themselves."
90.3."not as good as the others Tess Lindsay has spent most of her life on an island of the Highlands. When Colin MacPherson ends up shipwrecked there, it starts to get interesting. She tells him all she remembers about herself and her old life. Finally she takes out a token, what she clenching when she arrived on the island, he realizes who she really is. An heir to the Lindsay clan in the highlands, for she is Theresa Catherine Lindsay. Her mother was a lowlander and her father was murdered. When they arrive they find out that her father's murderer, is after Tess still. She see's the face of him and when she visits her mother she sees him again. Colin follows her there to protect her but wonders if he will ever see her again. Will he? What will happen with the murderer see's Tess? Read the book to find out."
91.3."""Romance"" In my opinion Tess and the Highlander is a romantic construction. There is conflict, courage and loyalty in this novel. It is tremendously readable and has unforgettable characters."
92.1."ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."
93.3."life Like other reviews of LH's music before me, I must agree thathis music near the end of the 90s became more inst, and lessvocal. I wish that I could find his first lp from the 80sthat contained the superior track 'A Path'."
94.4."A good learning tool... While I am still in the process of learning the Yoruba language, I think that this book is a nice beginners tool. Please keep in mind that the new book comes with to audio CD's that are MUCH NEEDED! So if you're considering buying the book used, fine, but be sure to ask if the CD's come with.Without the audio assistance, I'm not sure how great of a tool this will be in your journey to learn the beautiful language of Yoruba!Best,S"
95.2."Not the best I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills."
96.4."Great Source for Yoruba I recommend this book highly. I have a competitor's text also and while it is useful, I appreciate the format of Beginner's Yoruba which is interactive. The companion CDs that come with this book are simply outstanding. I especially enjoy the fact that the book is respectful of ALL religions.As an update after using the CDs for a few weeks, it is true that the speaker who speaks fastest on the CD does make many mistakes. I noted errors on greetings. These are rather odd to say the least. However, I still think this is a great source! My toddler is learning right along with me and she demands I play the CD everyday! As we repeat phrases, I simply correct the errors. I really appreciate the different participants on the CD and the dialogues which are authentic and properly contextualize the vocabulary.The phrase ""O'ngbiyanju"" is priceless!"
97.5."Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too."
98.5."We Love This Game! I bought this game to bring down to my vacation home, a new game that the kids do not have at home. Every time we go to the house, the kids want to play Gobblet first! It is just like tic-tac-toe, but you can eat up your opponent's pieces with your own larger pieces. It is a game of strategy. My 7 year old enjoys beating her 17 year old cousins in this game, before they figure out how to do it. My 5 year old can beat his cousins as well. I would recommend it."
99.5."Fabulous!!! After doing alot of researching and reading reviews I purchased Kelly's Pet Parade and it is fabulous.My four year old daughter has has no problems playing it without any supervision. Ability to use the mouse is important.She can keep the different activities as simple or as elaborate as she wants to.When you want to do a new parade you have to use a different name (susie2 etc.) or erase the saved parade.The whole thing is just darling and fun to play. My daughter has to do 30 minutes of a math or alphabet game before she can play Kelly's Pet Parade. So, she likes it so much that using it as a reward has worked."
100.3."Annie Peanut Shoes Don't usually purchase shoes without trying them on first and I should have stuck with my rule. They are advertised as a Wide, but actually they didn't feel like it. The quality of the shoe is Wonderful and the shoe is really cute. I think it would be great for the average foot. I'm wondering since they put elastic in the shoe, that's what they considered ""wide"". Since I wore it once, I probably can't return it. If you have a regular width foot, I'd order this. Cute shoe!"
101.5."Cool Music This cd is soooo cool. Especially the non-stop megamix the transitions are perfect, but you could be annoyed by the constant voice of the announcer. Some of what he says is very corny but you should be able to live with it (Especially when you're playing the actual game). All in all it's a great CD and a great buy."
102.1."I got fooled... I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!"

106.4."Stephen F. Miller Place, NY King James by Ryan Jones is a biography of Lebron's James' life prior to going into the NBA. It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person."
107.5."ESTE LIBRO CONTIENE TODO LO QUE PENSE QUE NO ME INTERESABA SABER SOBRE EL BOX Y SUS CAMPEONES...PERO ME CAUTIVO Y LO LEI HASTA EL FINAL !AHORA SI PUEDO DISCUTIR DE BOX CON MI ESPOSO Y MIS CUÑADOS...¡Y HASTA CON MI SUEGRO, QUE ES EX BOXEADOR !"

109.3."Like fruit loops but much sweeter I tried these on a whim several weeks ago to offset the amount of chocolate I had eaten that week. It was nice and sweet for a few weeks with that first box. But then I tried it again this week and the aftertaste was so strong. The overall texture and layout of each piece is like Fruit Loops but with tons of honey add and less fruit or frosting. One box should be more than enough."
110.5."Fabulous! This book has been completely instrumental in guiding my husband in his timberframing pursuits. He has read it so much the cover and binding have fallen off and broken! But he holds on to it because it's the BEST reference for a DIYer to look to when starting your structure."
111.4."Ok reference book Dated (1980's) so don't expect a lot of current technology for this ancient craft. A pretty good read and part of my collection. This book is also co-authored by Sobon. Of the three (Build a Classic Timber-Framed House, Timber Frame Construction: All About Post-and-Beam Building and this one), you need this one the least. Interesting history but not so much on the construction aspect."
112.2.no technical information this book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building
113.1."you will not be able to buils a timber frame house This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder."
114.2."Poor instructions, but once you figure it out... kinda cool These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in ""hot"" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, ""well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose.""Should be more explicit in the instructions. (We were using the star wars version of this product)."
115.5."Great Classic Sega Arcade Racing Action! If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it, then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables, which you get by playing and earning miles, as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP, for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style, or sequentially, or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable, fun, and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours, but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then."
116.4."Fun and Simple I really enjoyed playing this game when I went to the arcade. They preserved the arcade feel and kept it very simple. It is a fast paced game that is fun for everyone."
117.2."Not Patterns - but Detailed Sketches Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book."
118.5."Pyrography Desings Love this book. Lots of patterns and instructions. Can't wait to start woodburning projects. Borders and patterns are just lovely!!!"
119.4.pyrography designs this is a good book for more of the advanced pyrographer rather than the beginner the designs are really great though
120.3."disappointing... I looked forward to watching this movie, but was disappointed. Overall it is well made, but the representation of St. Francis was at best disappointing. I realize St. Francis's life was not a bed of roses, but there was almost no joy *AT ALL* in his life, according to this movie. Far too much crying for his character lines.Also, it was troubling to have St. Francis represented as someone almost bordering on disobedience to the Pope when he requests approval for his order. It is one thing to speak freely but they carried it too far for the saint who ""rebuilt Christ's church."""
121.1."Dont like it This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use."
122.5."Excellent - as good as it gets! Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!"
123.3."Singer writes scary stories ""The Seance"" is a collection of short stories. It portrays the lives of Jewish characters in Eastern Europe between the wars.I found the book a little hard to read. Singer paints his characters so clearly, you can actually smell them. That is sometimes too hard to take. I saw my grandmother in his pictures and it wasn't to pleasant."
124.3."Hard to get thru, but worth it in the end The O'Neills' exciting, original approach to married life shows you and your mate how the stifling, limited arrangement you've always thought marriage had to be can be opened up into an honest, undemanding, joyful relationship. they'll introduce you to the OPEN MARRIAGE concepts-trust, liking, role flexibility, individual freedom and growth, and love and sex without jealousy-that can do wonders for your marriage. OPEN MARRIAGE must be read before you get married-or before your marriage gets a day older!~*~This book needs to modernized. I see there is a 1984 version, but I don't know how that fits in today's age. It is a dry read, but I pushed thru and did get a few ideas to allow my own marriage to grow and flourish."
125.1."Not professional quality I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others."
126.2."three to four stars - depending... Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students."
127.2."Good songs, bad cover. This CD compilation set was purchased for me. I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they're poorly covered by ""the Starlite Singers""."
128.1."New Wave 80s I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it."
129.1."Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!! This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!"
130.5."Picture Quality Still Holds Up I bought this Handycam 10 years ago. I stopped using it for whatever reason. But I recently set out to convert the video I had taken with this to digital. Not only was it easy, but the quality of the picture was amazing...even playing it on my 40 inch screen. The image is so much better than my phone new camcorder."
131.1."BEWARE!! Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ...."
132.3."Undecided on product, but Electro Island is A+++ customer service! I currently have this item for my S/E z500a phone. Though it doesn't seem to work yet, I will say that Electro Island is working with me on a daily basis to get it up and running...More to follow. This vendor has some of the best and most polite service I've encountered from an online purchase."
133.4."Good cable to have This is a good cable to have. You don't need to subscribe to the data service to download/upload pictures and ringtones to your phone. This cable pays for itself in about one month."
134.1."Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for."
135.4."Problems with internet - but a good magazine I received ""free"" access to the BA web page (all links) with my subscription...however, about every 3rd time I logged on, my username was declared invalid. I had to contact them several times before the problem was fixed. (It was fixed three times, and then it would fail again). The customer service people were friendly and helpful, but it was a little painful to have to keep asking for help.Outside of that - this is a great publication for people that are into fantasy baseball leagues that allow you to draft minor leaguers - or ""long term keeper"" leagues....or if you are just a fan of baseball and really like to learn a lot about the up and coming player.I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the internet problem....."
136.1."""Uh oh he's been using Brand X"" An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real ""fusion"" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?"
137.3."Nice quality, but will not stack well My grandson is only 10 months old, so right now, he enjoys shaking and looking at the blocks. What I am disappointed in is the fact that they will not stack very well at all. He tried to put one on the other and it falls right off. They are slippery and not formed so that they can be stacked without falling off each other. Maybe I'm ""old school"", but I think blocks should be for education with alphabet and even more so, for stacking ability. They are cute, well made, and I will use them as a learning tool for the alphabet with the figures that represent each letter inside the block, but I guess we won't be stacking them!I got a better price buying directly from the fisher price web site catalog. (about $30 with shipping)"
138.2."Great for Twins I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. They are just over 8 months old and they love them. This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! I would recommend this to anyone, plus I love Fisher Price."
139.2."Would have expected better! I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters. However, the letters are rubbing off. For the price I paid that was dissapointing. Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun."
140.3."Cute Blocks But Expensive These blocks are really colorful and cute, however, when you take into consideration the price, I am not sure they are worth it."
141.5."Fun selection of blocks! Great alternative to the traditional alphabet blocks I love the Peek-a-blocks sets that are out there and I was excited to see the alphabet set available. Every child should have a set of alphabet blocks and these are so much more fun than the basic wood ones. A few people have said that the letter obstructs what is inside, but I don't really agree. While they do have the letter on the one side, you get three other sides to view the inside object just fine. And isn't the point of the alphabet block the letter anyway? It is nice that it comes in a reusable case with a handle too. Just make sure and do your research before you bought. I did some digging around online and got this set for only $25!"
142.5."These are great! Love These! However, do not buy these with the big block activity center, they don't work! A bit dissapointing. But the blocks are really cute and I do like them a lot!"
143.3."Alphabet blocks don't make individual sounds on Incrediblock. Bought these for my baby along with the Incrediblock. The blocks are adorable, but when you put them on the Incrediblock, it doesn't make individual letter sounds for them, which is what I expected for the price.It turns out that only the 13 blocks that come with the Incrediblock make any kind of individual noises. These just play random music, which is fine, but I really bought this for the purposes of it being a really educational toy, which it really isn't at this point.The description really should explicitly tell you this."
144.3."Not so great, but not a terrible product It's a nice length and width, but it's very loud when it's on (you can't hear it if you have a fan/tv on and it's under the covers, but other wise, people can hear it through the door) and it seems like most of the vibrating power is on the ""handle"" rather than any other point along it.It's an okay item for the price, but it's not the best out there. You won't be horribly disappointed if you buy it, but you're not missing anything spectacular by passing it up."
145.4."Very thorough... What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's an invaluable resource for both published and non-published writers alike. The only complaint I have is that I would have liked to have seen a CN designation for ""Creative Non-Fiction."""
146.5."Telling it like it is! The book came within 5 days Yeah!!! It was in perfect condition. This is a great read!"
147.5."Pretty Nifty! I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
148.5."Toned If you do this video regularly, you will see results. I've used it before on weight-loss plans and I have always been able to see my body change. Because of the warm up and cool down, I never got sore. And even when I was 150 pounds overweight, I could still do the video. It's my all time favorite."
149.5."This must be a must-read I surft on this book out of mild curiosity. But reviews like the three posted here convince me that the book must be well worth reading. So I'm buying it. Thanks, team! (I apologize for the 5 stars, since I haven't read it yet. But the program wouldn't let me post this comment without a rating. I'll get back to y'all when I'm finisht reading the book.)"
150.1."Molly Myers Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
151.5."The greenest grass imaginable I bought this book for my husband. He follows it faithfully, and you can see the results in our yard. We have the most beautiful, lush grass in the neighborhood - which seems to be a miracle, since our yard was an overgrown field just two years ago. Jerry Baker provides simple ways to establish and maintain your lawn. I also appreciate the fact that we do not have to go to a gardening store to find the items recommended in his book."
152.3."Good information but very disorganized General information is good. Jerry writes about everything from lawn equipment, watering, home to homemade tonics. However, the book is very disorganized. Jerry did a very poor job of summarizing the steps to a great lawn."
153.2."It's a knock off. The official Chrono Trigger OST has 3 discs. This version has some of the major tracks on it, the audio quality is good, but Caveat Emptor (buyer beware) this is a Chinese knock-off.Oh and if you buy the 3 disc version, make sure the cover does not have a green and red logo reading ""FX"", for this is also a counterfeit. The serial numbers on the real soundtrack CDs are PSCN-5021, PSCN-5022, and PSCN-5023."
154.1."Just a few. These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
155.4."Mask Maker I saw this at a store and the cover is probably the best i've seen in a long time. However, you cannot judge a horror movie but it's cover. 9 out of 10 times the movie will suck. Mask Maker is about a couple who buy a home in the middle of nowhere. A long time ago the woman who lived there was accused of being a witch and was killed by the towns people and so was her baby. Her husband whoses face was horribly burned saw the entire event, I might have missed something. Anyways, the man unearths a stick in the graveyard behind there house and the man is resurrected. If you're a person who needs to see someone killed every ten minutes, then this movie is not for you. It's slow placed but the kills are well done. The killer looks like the new Leatherface without muscles. The ending was a typical slasher ending and I guess there will be another part made. I'd welcome a sequel since this did have potential.Overall, a good horror movie that was a little slow paced."
156.2."It was ""ok"" but I won't watch it again I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen."
157.3."Combination of a suspense and slasher movie that drags on too long. A low rate, not that scary ""Poltergeist"". I say C What if your dream turned out to be a nightmare? After Jennifer's (Deloach) boyfriend Evan (Colletti) surprises her with a new house for her birthday strange things begin to happen. This is a hard movie to review. It is not that bad, but it drags, a lot. It's another haunted house because of something buried in the land movie that is not that bad, but it would have been a good ""Fangoria Series"" movie at an hour long, trying to stretch it out for an hour and a half really hurt the movie. If you are looking for a decent horror movie that is a cross between suspense and a slasher, this is a good choice. If you are looking for a very scary movie then I would go for something else. Not terrible, not great. I did like the ending though. I give it a C.Would I watch again? - I doubt it."
158.3."mask maker A guy buys a house for his girl and there friends come to celebrate. Then they die by some masked guy who reminds you of leather face from Texas C. The deaths were alright and the storyline was good enough. His masks were basically the faces of whoever he killed which is easy to get in general. Plus they do show the backdrop to who this killer is and why everything is happening, so it was fun to watch this C horror film but don't rush out to buy it."
159.4."mask maker I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert."
160.4."NOT the worst American B-Movie This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!"
161.2."MASK OF FAMILIARITY MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need."
162.4."Chinese medicine I wanted a book that could give me a guide to Chinese Medicine that would help me understand what it is and how it linked with the things I have picked up in my life. Thank you for the author and producers of this book for going a long way to helping me achieve a basic and fundamental understanding of the subject.There may well be other books on the topic of equal merit, I simply have read few.In Love and Light"
163.5."Best game ever This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play."
164.4."pioneering ambient direction for Hillage Released after 'green' in 1979, this album of what was then considered experimental electronic music, now called 'ambient', is a seminal document in the field. more joyous and uplifting, and more engaging principally than others experimenting in the field at the same time, these two performances contain beautiful and melodic synth textures over which Hillage provides some liquid guitar work. it would take 12 years before Hillage would pursue this direction again in system 7 and climb the electronic heights."
165.4."Buyer beware, NO bonus tracks! The original version of this CD (On Caroline Records) was wonderful. The reason I purchased the remastered version was in hopes that it would have bonus tracks on it. Contrary to the product description, there are NO bonus tracks on this CD, hence the four-star rating."
166.1."Stiff and Smells like drying paint You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close."
167.3."You get what you paid for... I got this pillow at Target a year ago and initially, it was the worst pillow Ever. It was not at all comfortable and I only used it as a back cushion for when I'm sitting up in bed.Now, this pillow is very soft and doughy and comfortable to lie on. It's not a hard brick like it used to be. So unless you're willing to wait a while and ""break in"" is pillow, I wouldn't recommend getting this."
168.3."Contour Pillow This pillow has helped my neck pain, doctor recommended that I get one. It is fairly small, so would be ideal for travel. I may invest in a little better quality pillow if it continues to help my neck/spine."
169.4."Good I like this pillow very much. I was in an accident when I was younger and I have trouble using most pillows, but this one is very good for me. If I move around too much and I sleep in a weird position it's not good, but that happens with every pillow."
170.2."Don't bother The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new."
171.2."Will not be purchasing another one of these It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed."
172.1."False Advertisement The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied."
173.2."Not Like the Old Formula The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review."
174.1."The product I received this time is like fake one I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount."
175.2."If it ain't broke don't fix it I have been using this product for 5+ years. It was wonderful. About 1 year ago the company changed packaging and the product changed slightly. The bottle is taller now and something is missing from the serum. Doesn't work as well as it used to work. I will not be purchasing this item because of the change."
176.3."It's okay but........ My 7 year old got this for her birthday recently. She wanted this really bad and I thought I wouldn't be able to get her off the computer once she started. She's only played it about 4 or 5 times in the last month. She enjoys it when she's playing but once you've put on a show, there's not any challenge left. Not the worst computer game we've bought but it could have been far better!!"
177.5."barbie games havnt been better!!!! this is a rockin game its fun and you can even skate in the sky. i love choosing from like 30 outfits. i ordered from online(well my mom did it for me)and it took 3 weeks to get here and when it came i was sad because people said its a bad game but it wsant dont listen t anyone its soooooooo much fun!!!!!"
178.2."4 year old BORED with this after 2 weeks I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it."
179.4."Memorial Album of the Musical 7 - Kaguya Shima Densetsu This cd comes from the Memorial Album of the Musical 7 - Kaguya Shima Densetsu which stars famous idol, Fumina Hara as Sailor Moon. This is Fumina Hara's second stage playing sailor moon in the sailor moon musicals and this is the last cd released from her stage. This contains many popular songs but it is the first and only ever memorial musical cd released without the sailor moon musical's theme song, La soldier. Besides this, this cd (although not the best one) contains many good songs including Link, I do Justice, and Everlasting Moonlight. There are slow songs on this cd, but most of them are up beat songs. This cd contains beautifully arranged songs as well as good battle songs. :)"
180.2."Fire Truck Puzzle The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. It is very colorful and well worth the price. The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it. But I am very pleased with the quality."
181.4."Dark Horses a must have CD I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon."
182.1."Has No Range I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product."
183.5."Great gadget I bought a couple of the singles and one of the triples and they all work perfectly. I'm disappointed the triple is not available and may not be. Use them in my office where the triple handles the three lamps, and in the house where three singles are with three different lamps in the bedroom, home office and basement. Makes it nice to turn all the lights on from one place (my desk in the office) or from the door so you don't have to walk into a dark room and grope for the lamp switch. Used daily for about 6 weeks and going strong. I've had others in the past and they have lasted years and years. These are nicely made and seem durable. Mounting is a good idea so you don't end up groping for the remote in the dark!"
184.1."Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon."
185.3."Partially works I bought the 3 pack that comes with a single remote (very convenient). I've rated it down a bit because while this product works well with lamps and fans that have knobs that you turn, it only half works with fans or other products that turn on with buttons. For example, I have a fan that you press the button three times to go from low to high to off. The remote will turn it off, but won't turn it back on. Same thing with a button-only air conditioner. Since I bought it to use with two items that have buttons, I was disappointed it wouldn't turn those back on. However, it does turn my twist-dial fan both on and off."
186.1."Does not work! It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it."
187.5."BEST BOOK EVER!! This is 1 of da bst books dat i have EVER read! @ my school, we are doing a play on this & im playin Mary-Lynette. i cant wait 2 get to the last chapters when they finally give in 2 each other! Gr8 books!"
188.3."three sisters to die for....... Once started I couldn't put it down, literally. I didn't stop til I'd read it through.Three sisters on the run from the Night Worlds patriachal society, they visit Oregon. Their brother finds out where they are and tries to drag them back, except for a few minor details he has it all figured out. 1. someone else knows where the girls are and if Ash doesn't bring them back, Quinn will bring in the authorities. 2. Ash has found his soulmate Mary-Lynette who also knows their secret identity. 3. someone killed their aunt and they don't know who, is it a vampire hunter or someone who knows the truth.The vampires are in danger and Ash and Mary-Lynette have fallen in love. END"
189.5."THE BEST OF THE BEST BOOKS Hey every one how did you like this book. It was the best book I have ever read of the L.J Smith."
190.5."The best of the ""Night World"" series I loved this book very much!It was excellent.I absoloutly fell in love with Jeremy.He was such a sweet,nice guy.I thought it was unfair that he died.The last few times I read this book I had tears streaming down my face.I really don't think he was crazy just misunderstood.This is a must read book. Once you pick it up you can't put it down."
191.3."weird! It was a good book. But the thing I don't understand is how Mary-Lynnette and Mark drank Kestral, Jade and Rowan's blood while being human. Yecch!. On top of that the blood tasted sweet and smelled like Vanilla. Gimme a break!"
192.5."The BEST book of the Night World series!!!!! This book was great and I just loved Ash. It should have 5 stars from everyone. And you have to read it. It was great. I did not like what happened to Jeremy but it was still the best book in the Night World series! It keeps you reading to the end. You will not put it down. I hope you read it for your sake. So read it!!"
193.5."Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
194.5."The best book in the ""Night World"" Series Daughters of Darkness is quite possibly the best book in the new NIGHT WORLD series by L. J. Smith. It does not just revolve around one supernatural being or one singular person, it has interesting information on the werewolves of the NIGHT WORLD and the plot line is out of sight. I own all of the books in the series (Up untill Soulmate that is) and so far Daughters of Darkness is the best one. I only hope the following books in this wonderful series are as great as this one!!"
195.4."Daughters of Darkness: A must read This second book in the Night World series does not compare with the first, but is good in it's own right. The three sisters are intriguing, and Ash, who was introduced in the first book, does a turnabout and becomes a guy any girl would want to marry. Overall, this book was very good, and for the vampire lover, a must read"
196.5."It is the best book in the series. This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book."
197.5."If you're into vampire and romance you should read this book You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible."
198.3."It was ok I thought Kestrel was pretty cool, but overall, this book was definitely NOT one of LJ's best. HELLO!!! HOw could pretty much everyone here rate this book 9-10???? It was NOT THAT GOOD. My reason is because MARY-LYNETTE S****D> she was another one of LJ's cheesy perfect charactesr and the fact taht she ended up with the vampire hottie was blah, too predictable. It was way too ""Happy Ending"" for me."
199.5."READ IT READ IT READ IT! This book is incredible. It had me hooked from the very beginning. Why does everyone always say that they're in love with Ash? He's a great character, but not perfect in any way. Okay, ehough chit-chat. Read this book, I am serious. Rowan (my favorite!), Kestral, Jade, and Mary-Lynnette are just about the strongest female characters I have read in some time. I can find no flaw in any part of this book, and if you haven't already, READ IT!"
200.5."the best! This book is my favorite one. I've read it eight times. All of L.J. Smith's books are fantastic; she's my absolute favorite writer. Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
201.5."Vampires and Witches, oh yes! I have been a fan of L.J. Smith ever since book one of _The Vampire Diaries_. With each of her books you can honestly BELIEVE that what she is writing about is the truth, even if the characters are ficticious. Dughters of Darkness (as well as any Night World book or the Vampire Diaries trilogy) should be required reading for anyone who believes in Vampires (or thinks they are one *grin*). Happy reading"
202.2."Disappointing I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead."
203.2."Don't Waste Yout Time Unless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class, I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long, boring text. If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time, most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information; but it's dry, overly-intellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested. If you're looking for a challenge to read, you face two; deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences, and staying awake. I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it."
204.2."Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time."
205.4."Highlight Of BODY LANGUAGE As with the previous two singles from her sorely overlooked BODY LANGUAGE set, Minogue manages to go for something light years away from what many consider her given forte', that being straight up dance music. It's a shame that the singles from the album have met with only modest success(and the album itself even less so). This is another first-rate track, probably the best on the album, though I must say the re-recorded single version dwarfs in comparison to the magnificent album version, which may have not been considered ""commercial"" enough for radio.The remixes here are fine, the bonus track ""City Games""(rumored to be the original choice as the album's title track) not so much, and the video lovely. Unfortunately, this looks to be the last single from BL--I suspect in the not-so-distant future we will witness the return of Disco/Dance Kylie with a ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" beat pulsing not too far behind."
206.3."Great Song, But... ""Chocolate"" was the best song on Ms. Minogue's Body Language album, but this single gives you a truncated version. It's shorter, with some added effects. It looses a lot of the flow which makes the album version so memorable. The bonus track, ""City Games"" is nothing noteworthy, and the ""Chocolate"" remixes just further dimishish the orginal song. The live version of ""Love At First Sight"" is alright, but Kylie is not great to listen to live. On the positive side, the enhanced video is very stylish. That is the only reason to buy this single."
207.4."Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times! Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again"
208.3."not interesting enough for little ones I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this particular video. My two year old does not have any interest in the between episode segments where parents and kids talk about their feelings for Thomas. I think it may have mads an interesting documentary for older kids who had liked Thomas as small children but for little kids, it does not hold their interest long enough to get to the next story. Perhaps if the video allowed you to skip the segments or turn them off like the producer notes in movies, it would be a nicer experience."
209.4."Son enjoys Thomas and Friends My son enjoys watching Thomas and Friends. It's one of the only shows he will sit still for. Having 10 years of the best shows for him to watch is a joy and a treat for him.Thanks again,James Rivers Jr."
210.1."Extremely Disappointed with this video I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
211.2."Not as expected... My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!"
212.5."great Bought it for my 2.5 year old niece and she loved it. Dinner got easier with this disc.I think it should work fine for just any kid that age."
213.4."Great for kids. My youngest grandson is into Thomas and he will watch this video as well as others over and over as long as it is Thomas and all his friends."
214.3."Not exactly as the pictures The picture showed two engines, one gold and one blue with number ""1"".But the one I got isn't includes those two trains. It came with two blue trains.The DVD are 63 minutes and 60 minutes Bonus Features. My kids love it!"
215.2."Just so-so This is a DVD with footage of a ""Come Out and Meet Thomas"" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the ""party/interview"" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either."
216.2."More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections."
217.1."A long promo for the Thomas center(s) Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money."
218.2."Poor DVD Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD."
219.4."Nice Thomas Sampler Marking the 10th Anniversary of Thomas videos (certainly NOT the stories themselves), this sampler covers a fine cross-section of Thomas adventures (though they are presented out of order), musical numbers (all catchy and certain to infect your child's brain along with yours), and interviews with people of all ages visiting ""A Day Out With Thomas."" I was fortunate enough to catch one of these outings a few years backs, but since I am a parent of a child with a severe developmental disability, I got more of a chance to ""experience"" the day on the video than I did in person.Anyway, this is a nice hour of Thomas magic and a good introduction to see whether Thomas is right for your child. Highly recommended here."
220.1."My Son finds it annoying My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
221.2."Feels like a commercial... All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*"
222.4."Inventive, Nashville-type film Ripe political satire is experienced in camping Cosmos during 1986 where the apathetic beach campers are more interested in the beauty contest, the closeted gay exercise coach, eating french fries and watching soccer games on the big screen TV than the tirades of a visiting writer along with a frustrated anarchist and his former girlfriend who is also a terrorist sympathizer. The writer gets a pie in his face in a radio interview and the anarchist finally gets a hearing of his propaganda between rounds of a boxing match. Two youngsters fall in love at a sweethearts dance. Of course, the big draw to this film is a brief appearance of late adult film star Lola Ferrari who made the Guinness Book of Records title for having the world's largest breasts. The fantasy scenes featuring her are more attractive than you would expect."
223.5.3 at night I take 3 at night be for I got to bed, it helps me rest better!! TRY IT!! AND THE PRICE IS OK
224.3."Huge Capsules These capsules are huge, almost an 1 inch long and big around. I won't order again as they are too difficult to swallow."
225.5."APC P1T 120V Portable Surge Protector Perfect carry-along for my notebook PC. Useful grounded and protected indicators. Small investment for critical protection. I have used APC products for quite a number of years and have found them reliable.APC P1T 120V Portable Surge Protector"
226.5."Insurance policy! This protector is an excellent value. Rated very highly in consumer publications. Great price from Amazon. I bought this to protect my new 55 inch LG flat screen."
227.5."Great Pants These are great pants. They are really comfortable and easy to care for. I'm saving money too because I don't have to take these to the dry cleaners. I love the ""Individual Fit"" waste band. Who wouldn't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size."
228.3."Not the product described I ordered these slacks specifically because the description said they had a comfort-fit waistband. I am an ostomy patient and occasionally need that little extra inch the elastic expansion in the waistband gives you. Despite clearly stating that these pants had that comfort-fit waistband, the pants I received did not have it. In all other regards these pants are perfectly fine, They fit well, and are in every other respect exactly what I expected. However, the fact is that they are still not what I ordered and are not as described."
229.3."Nice looking for mid seasons Nice pants, well made, but should be announced with a light textile compared with the pants I bought in France. I Still happy to find fashioned double pleat pants."
230.3."Quality varies I bought 3 pants.2 were in a great shape.1 had a hole in the seams and a week later I found another one."
231.2."Wrong item sent. I got the shippment quickly. But wrong items was sent. I have to return it to the seller. I got the refund pretty quick, but only for the value of product. I spent about &10 for two way shipping without geting anything."
232.1."Too bad.... Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad."
233.1."Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again."
234.3."Mixed feelings While the quality of the product is great, like so many wash pants today, there is no room at the waist for making adjustments. The rear seam is extremely tight, and while it can be taken in with difficulty, there is no room for letting out even 1/2 inch. Purchase a size above your waist size, and unless you can do it yourself, be prepared to pay for making these a good fit. Of course, if you don't mind bunching at the waist, you'll be OK."
235.4."Fit great The pants are very soft and comfortable. The color holds up fairly well, but I do wish the darker colors held better. I do recommend them."
236.2."Don't Trust the Images Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. ""Cafe,"" for example, should be ""Coffee."" Despite the fact that the image for ""Cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""Cafe"" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got."
237.5."Satisfied Product arrive well ahead of schedule, met expectations, and price was better than local retail."
238.2."So disappointed I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are ""deals"" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron."
239.3."OK fit, decent value and wear. Fit was decent. A little more snug than I had wanted or expected, color was lighter than it appeared when ordering. Also, the rise was a little shorter than I prefer to wear my slacks.They have worn well."
240.4."A general guide for the interpretation of analytical data This book is a remarkable exposition of the importance of the information-theoretical concepts in the understanding of chemical analysis, as well as a guide for practical usage of these powerfull mathematical and conceptual tools. The main merit of the book is the clear and rigorous analysis of many laboratory metodologies and systems, which makes evident the adequacy of information-theoretical concepts in description and analysis. It covers a great amount of the analytical chemistry scope, with subjects like: -IDENTIFICATION OF COMPONENTS -QUALITATIVE -QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, both single and multiple -OPTIMIZATION of strategies -QUALITY ASSURANCE -STRUCTURE ANALYSIS -CHEMOMETRICS"
241.5."Favorite Characters and Lots of FUN This is a great leap pad book. My 4 yr old son loved it instantly. The familiar characters from the Bob the Builder show make this book lots more fun than the ones featuring the Frog. I especially liked the fact that this book helps to teach that teasing is not a nice thing to do. There are at least 2 games on every page and it has the music from the show also. It is definitely worth the price and I hope they make more Bob the Builder books for the Leap Pad."
242.5."helpful for decision makers This is an extraordinary compilation of texts of environment and economics that constitutes a very helpful book to decision makers. I work for environment and always check this book to take the best decision, because its contents are wide enough for diferent topics of environmental problems."
243.3."Methinks Bruno picked the wrong girl It was a bit difficult to sympathize with Bruno's obsession and heartbreak over such a vapid and shallow creature. Otherwise, this was a very charming book."
244.5."Delicious! I loved this book! Dating a chef now who is as passionate about his food and life as Bruno makes this book a complete treat. I was hungry with every page. The descriptions of the food and emotions are insipring and delicious.So worth the read! Have to go eat now!"
245.4."Food porn, and I mean that in the best possible way I didn't like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn't make me think, but, oh I didn't notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. During, I read and read, bathing in the glorious food descriptions, not to mention the allure of Italy. Oh Yes!"
246.3."Okay-Simple Read I read this book because it was selected by my book discussion group. Some day it might be made into a movie for Lifetime. Story takes place in the present in Italy. A young chef falls in love with a beautiful blonde American student. His friend a waiter starts to date her. The waiter passes himself off as a chef and asks his chef friend's help in preparing wonderful Italian dishes for the American girl. There's more to the plot. This is a lightweight novel- a beach book. I did want to visit Italy and eat Italian food. My book club's discussion was very short."
247.1."Do not waste your time....lousy This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier."
248.3."made me hungry Overall I enjoyed this book which was given to me as a gift.As a meat and potato eater, after reading the book I now find myself wondering if my taste in food is too simple. I've eaten out a couple of times since reading the book ordering food with strange-to-me ingredients. Have I been missing out in my dining life?There was no place for such vulgar swear words to be used. It should have been kept as an innocent, light book."
249.4."Book of Chance I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed."
250.2."Back to basics Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere."
251.2."CASH MONEY AND NO LIMIT ARE THA SAME THANG! THERE BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NO LIMITS BUT THERE FROM THA SAME PLACE AND THERE GHETTO HOOD IS VERY CLOSE.THEY RAP JUST LIKE NO LIMIT.BUT NO LIMIT WAS FIRST AND IT WILL BE THA LAST.NO LIMIT IS STILL NUMBER1 IN EVERY WAY."
252.1."this album is garbage,straight bfi material cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time."
253.4."One of Cashmoneys BEST Albums This is one of Cashmoneys best albums next to 400 Degreez and I got that work. I like to listen to dis when I`m ridin or gettin ready to go to work. It hypes me up. As a group, the hot boys were great. They all contribute something to the album make it sound hot. This album is a classic. Add it to your collection."
254.2."save your $$$ I can't believe how much this cd sucks, save yourself 17 bucks & just download the ""we on fire"" mp3 its the only decent track on the album. And if u r looking for more ""bounce"" party tracks like ""back that ass up"" too bad; u won't find any here. What a rip."
255.3."it's alright this and chopper city in the ghetto are the only decent albums 2 come out of cash money. if u want a good cd go pick up a master p cd those are awesome"
256.5."Why arent there more like this one!!?? why dont more rappers do what cash money does? no matter whos album it is, they showcase the best mcs and production they can pull off. there is nothing wrong with other rappers but cash money does this well, while setting asside tracks for the individuals, the group is what really shines, without the bling bling. i promised myself to never to buy the bling bling bull, but after hearing this cd, i had to get it. especially songs like i need a hot girl, and we on fire. get this cd!!!"
257.1."THIS IS A ONE COMPARED TO JUVENILEZ 400 DEGREEZ ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!"
258.3."this album is mediocre To me every song was either average or it sucked. For making 4 albums B.G. sucks I thought Chopper City in the Ghetto was his first album. Juvenille is straight, and Lil Wayne is the tightest in the whole Cash Money label. I was shocked when I heard #9 I Feel. Cash Money think the are taking over the rap industry. Yeah right tight as No Limit is they will always be second to them."
259.5."The hot boys always will keep it real ""they on fire!!!!"" you need to listen to me and buy the hottest cd by the hot boys cause if you like rap like me and you just wanna keep it real leave it up to the hot boys all of cash money they are just off the hook Adam"
260.5."IT'S HOT LIKE DA HOT BOYZ. THIS ALBUM HAS SOME OF THE TIGHTEST TRACKS I'VE HEARD IN A MINUTE. MY FAVORITE SONG IS I NEED A HOT GIRL. SICK UNCLE IS A VERY FUNNY SKIT. THE HOT BOYZ ALBUM COMES IN WITH A BOMB INTRO AND GOES OUT WITH A BANGING TRACK. I LOVE DA HOT BOYZ, ESPECAILY LIL' WAYNE, AND THEIR NEW CD."
261.5."Another Cash Money Classic This album is just more proof that Cash Money is one of the best record labels out there. It has the same kind of beats as the Juvenile and B.G. LP's. The Hot Boys combines those 2 artists with 2 newer talented artists, Lil Wayne and Turk. If Cash money keeps making albums like this, they will be as famous as No Limit, an 10 times better soon."
262.1."The worst rap I ever Heard This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk."
263.1."super wack just like No-Limit Cash Money has no shame at putting out garbage music.wack beats and no lyric ryhmes.who is buying this crab? all the stuff sounds the same and it's not that average.it's all bad."
264.2."ghetto foolishness i like the Hot Boys and really like Juvenile, but this is not good. the only thing good is ""we on fire"" and ""I need a hot girl"". just download those 2 songs onto your Ipod and skip this album."
265.3."I Need A Hot Album I Need A Hot Album and this one ain't that hot. I'm a Cash Money fan but I have to say thier are only two good songs on this album. All of the other songs are so slow and boring. Only get this cd if its really cheap."
266.2."Please try another Hot Boy album... Guerriula Warfare is an album I fell is something, and that something is everything. The lyrics are most of the time meanless and pointless. Also the beat and backround music of the songs sometimes don't even fit could for the lyrics or how the rapper is rapping. Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something. Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money, just please not this one..."
267.2."This CD iz Aight........... FIRST OF ALL HOW COME ALL YA'LL BE DISSIN' NO LIMIT (for all ya'll that did not diss em' dis ain't for you) WHAT YA'LL TALKLIN ABOUT CASH MONEY CAN NEVER GET WITH NO LIMIT AND THAT IS A FACT..... AND YOU ALL BE TALKIN ABOUT THEY BE SATIN THE SAY SHIT WHAT ABOUT THTA SORRY LIL' WAYNE BE SAYIN THE SAME SHIT FROM JUVENILE'S ALBUM AND B.G.'S BLING BLING(HA HA) WHAT KIND OF SONG IS THAT AND THEY BE SAYIN THEY FROM THE 3RD NO LIMIT HAS BEEN SAYIN THAT FOR THE LONGEST AND THEN THEY HAVE TO COME AND SAY THAT SHIT AMD THEN THEY START MAKIN' THEIR ALBUM COVER LIKE THEM WHAT KIND OF SHIT IS THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE TRU FORM CASH MONEY IS THE BIG TYMERS AND THAT IZ ALL I HAVE TO SAY AND NO ONE I MEAN NO ONE CAN GET WITH MY BOY 50$ FROM NO LIMIT IF YOU A REAL NO LIMIT YOU KNOW WHO HE IS..... AND I LIKE TO GIVE A SHOT OUT TO MY SOLDIERS.. HOODY HOOO...."
268.4."Gret Album This album is really sweet, unfortunately, it has it's share of stupis songs. If you buy the album, you should figure out pretty quick which ones are worth it and which ones aren't. Forgetting all of the pointless songs, overall, this album rocks!"
269.5."A Classic CD: A must get This a classic cd. The best cash money cd ever. Every song is off tha hook. Don't nobody want to see the HOT BOY$. All I have to say is can't wait till LET EM' BURN."
270.5."GET THIS ALBUM!! The Hot Boys tore it up on this one. They had hot tracks wit b.g., juvenile, lil wayne and others from cash money. Cash Money is gonna take over the music business baby!!!!!!!!"
271.4."Short book explaining Love and Logic At first I was disappointed that this wasn't a longer book, but then I realized that it is great to give away to curious friends and parents as an introduction to Love and Logic. I just wish it was a little cheaper."
272.5."It Works!! I have been struggling to have my children be more obedient and to stop arguing with and each other. They were unhappy, my husband was unhappy, and I was unhappy. This book gave us not only some general strategies but also some suggestions on what to say in various situations. We are making great progress and the children are using it at school. We are becoming a more happy family!!"
273.5."Book review This is a book for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent, raising responsible children. It can also be used on co workers and the rest."
274.5."WeiB FOREVER! This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that ""hunt the tomorrow"" of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see..."
275.3."Complete but Not Good This is a book that contains all of the answers to your HTML questions but finding them may be a frustrating task. The index is terrible. I tried to use this book for about 2 months before giving up in frustration. I can simply never find the answer to my question!If you know a little about HTML, but are looking for a reference for day-to-day use, this is a very poor choice."
276.4."Fantastic Advanced Course! Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced."
277.5."The Title Says it all I should just leave it at that, but I won't. When I got this book I was completly blind to the world of HTML, but now I have mastered it. This book starts off teaching the basics, like how to start your HTML document with the HEAD and BODY tags, and goes all the way into using HTML tables to design your website and using HTML forms. By the end of the book, I knew everything, and was able to move onto more advanced subjects such as PHP or CGI-scripting. This book is the perfect way to get started if you're interested in pursuing a career in web development or application programming. However, if you are not interested in learning HTML, this book is not for you. It is a complete reference and you need to read the entire book to take advantage of it. If you really want to learn HTML then buy this book, because it will be the first and the last you will ever need."
278.5."Most complete book about HTML i've ever seen. This is just the best HTML book I've got my hands on. Just about everything about HTML techniques you could think about is covered in this book. StyleSheets, DHTML, forms, frames .. it's all covered. a MUST have for the HTML-creator The 99 edition is even better than the 98 edition, because the overviews are now sorted by browser, instead of alphabethically."
279.5."Could Not Put the Book Down For such a fat book, I never dreamed I would read it from cover to cover. Everything you ever wanted to know about HTML is in this book. I am a beginner and this book has given me a great start."
280.3."Not a horrible place to start. I actually bought and read the ""The Complete Reference HTML second edition"".I'm sure they are similar with some slight additions explaining some newer browser compatibility issues and possible additions to HTML and the use of style sheets.The Second Edition was literally a bad book. My copy broke down and all the pages were falling out in clumps of about 50 pages making it tough to use.But the content of the book is simple. All or most of HTML uses, concepts and tags are explained one by one in a comprehensive manual-type book.Not a great Tutorial type book. Not really for beginners. This is definitly a great reference though. For those who know how to use HTML but need to ""checkup"" on some things sometimes this book is for them."
281.5."Simply awesome This book is just spectacular!I have been a web developer for several years now, and I have read many books about HTML and related subjects. This book covers it all. But not only does the author cover HTML extensively, but he also covers XML, XHTML, CSS (extensively), CSS2, JavaScript, CGI, SSI, ASP, Coldfusion, and fonts.Many examples are given in both code and URL, discussion, and the thoroughness of the author's coverage, makes this a first-rate book, in my opinion.Most remarkably, the author discusses this subject matter very simply and in a way that anyone can understand (probably). I've honestly never read a technical book as lucid as this one. I highly recommend it!If that was not enough, the book contains about 500 pages of appendices, covering extensively every topic related to web development that one might need. I'm not saying you won't need any other books to make fabulous web pages, but this book is amazingly comprehensive. The author's web site is nice too."
282.4."Thoughtful, contemporary fiction Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart."
283.5."A very useful tool Very good product. Got my as a gift a few years ago, and it works fine. While mine has mercury thermometers, it shouldn't make a difference from red spirit filled one. I keep it in the shop drawer, dig it out when I wonder abt the temp here in NW Fla, dampen the wick, give it a twirl for a couple of minutes, then read it. I spray a lot of lacquer, shellac, and varnish, and usually have to crank up the dehumidifier in the shop, especially in the summer months. All in all, Bacharach makes a very good and reliable tool."
284.5."One of the best classical music CD I have the original soundtrack for FF6 But I still love this CD. Well, since it's not OST so don't expect to hear the original music you heard while playing game. All pieces are played by symphony orchestra and, as a classical music lover myself, I enjoy this CD as much as Vivaldi's Four Season!! Every song was well rearranged and perfectly presented in symphonic style...Warning!! if you're only gamers and don't think any classical music is worth listening, don't buy this CD.. But if you're classical music lovers as well, buy it..!! Whether or not you've ever played the game, the beauty of the music will make you not to regret every penny you spend..!!"
285.1."My Daughter Hates It I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow."
286.2."bench The bench is very nice. I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched. I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic. wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on. the bench broke after sitting on it three times. The glider bar broke. the weld is not very good or sturdy."
287.5."Perfect glider It was easy to put together and works nice. Love sitting in it with my grandson and enjoying our time."
288.2."Gauges in chair arms Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product. Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised. I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them."
289.5."Even a Blonde...... Speaking as a blonde I can say that this is EASY to put together.Some of the very best instructions I have seen anywhere. Great Buy and a beautiful product. It holds up to 550 pounds, so it will even hold most Americans!"
290.3."Nice but... This bench was easy to put together but was a two person job. It is a beautiful accent to our yard but I don't like the fact that is has a really short swing to it. Still, I believe we will get years of enjoyment out of it."
291.4."Practical glider Bought this as an anniversary gift for my parents knowing they needed seating out near a family pond. Looked at wicker, aluminum products etc., but knew this would stand the test of the elements. Easy to put together (less than an hour) and comfortable to sit in. Only complaint would be its appearance - very plain looking and the ""putty"" color = gray doesn't really help matters. If you don't care about aesthetics, purchase this bench for comfort and security in knowing it will last outside in the weather."
292.2."Seal IV I am a huge fan of Seal's first 3 albums, so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out. What a disappointment!! Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes. The only 2 with that eerie signature 'Seal' sound are 'heavenly' and 'tinsel town'. I'd say go to Itunes....listen to the songs...buy the tunes you like (if there are any) and call it a day."
293.4."Boone Dry Erase Markers I was really happy to find out that I was still able to purchase Boone dry erase markers from Amazon. They are no longer sold in the local stores and I find that I like them much better than the Expo markers because of the ""medium"" or ""bullet"" point option that was offered. Expo does not offer this option. Delivery was fast and efficient. Thanks Amazon!"
294.2."Too Much on the Mystical Plate The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored."
295.3."Cute storyline in the beginning After the first half it's not as magical, though still full of undying love as most SRK movies are ."
296.2."an extreme emotional ride If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway)."
297.3."Mixed feelings Some beautiful scenery early on and nice romantic sequences but somehow it degraded onto some of the worst aspects of couple bickering and lack of generosity in the SRK character. His bad behaviour in this movie really doesnt have much of a redeeming feature and is not something I like to hang out with. The movie ends with some reconciliation then more bickering.Don't they learn? (as in other Indian movies) They are either as dysfunctional as each other, or this relationship has a 'use-by' date.I usually like these two actors but this is one DVD I decided not to hang onto even though I have quite a few with SRK. Not a favorite."
298.3."Not my favorite Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl is already engaged to another. Boy chases girl across the world to try to woo her. Girl loves boy. They live happily ever after. That's the first 30 minutes of this movie. And if you've ever seen a Bollywood movie before, you know there's at least 2 and 1/2 hours left. So what do they fill it up with? Bickering. Mindless arguing that continues through nearly every minute of the movie. The movie was fine the first time through... though with all that fighting 3 hours seemed like 3 years.... but I'll probably never watch this one again. On my list of Great, Good, and Terrible Bollywood movies this is on the low end of Good. But it was good to see both Shah Rukh Khan and Rani again. They're wonderful!"
299.4."Pretty Damn Good A good short album. Mostly comprised of bonus tracks from previous releases. Entombed always picks good unique cover songs and makes them their own. Good for fans of the band, and no it isn't death metal, it doesn't sound like Wolverine Blues either, grow up people. It is a better release than Same Difference which I didn't care for except a song here or there. I do respect Entombed for trying new sounds and for releasing something on a yearly basis, unlike most bands. Pick this one up."
300.5."We love Mercer Mayer! My kids love the little critter books, and this is no exception. Great for my 3 year old, and even my 7 year old isnt bored too much by it. He enjoys reading it to his little brother at bedtime."
301.2."bye bye mom and dad My children and I love the little Critter books. This is a great book, but it was not bound well. The book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it."
302.4."Riveting I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special ""gifts"" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has ""gifts"" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the ""I hate you!"" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting."
303.2."Not her best........... Before I begin, let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential, but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards."
304.3."Scarletti Curse (candleglow) I would have enjoyed it more if the hero had some other powers other then being able to read minds, which by the way he's not very good at it.Or he should have been able to read the minds of who was betraying him and trying to kill him & his new bride. When the plot seems to be in trouble with no way out he can read thoughts. And only when the heroine is distressed,or in trouble. Who only questions him about his ability after she's married to him. And she keeps getting into trouble because he won't tell her anything, just keeps patting her on the head and telling her not to worry, he will protect her. Which he also doesn't do to well. The plot is long and at times boring. I hope Ms. Feehan stays with her paranormal charactars."
305.3."disappointing read As an avid reader of Christine Feehan, I was pretty excited when ""Scarletti Curse"" was published. Unfortunately, the novel did not live up to expectations. Unlike Feehan's earlier novels, these characters were not well-developed, and the plot was relatively shallow. There were flashes of Feehan's characteristic imagination, but over all it was a disappointing read."
306.2."This one is missing that Feehan Spark This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a ""mystery"" plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read."
307.2."Too Boring This book had great potential that it did not live up to. I hope she goes back to writing more ""Dark Series"" books. This book needed more action and more editing - it was way too long for the amount of plot it had. :-("
308.3."Good, except...... This was a great book! But the dialogue between Nicoletta and her guardian just seem to drag on forever! I missed the intense dialogue that Feehan usually devotes to the two leads. It seemed that they had very little interaction except for the last 1/4 of the book. Why such devotion to this mother-daughter relationship when it didn't seem to lead to anything crucial within the story? It really detracted from the couple's story. Other than that, the two leads were great and I agree with previous entrys - PLEASE write a book on the other brothers."
309.2."disappointed i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again."
310.2."Not up to scratch! I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this."
311.3."again having a hard time getting into this one. I have read about 1/2 of this.... it goes somewhat w/ the Dark series but I haven't gotten far enough to recognize any names yet."
312.3."It was OK This book was a bit different for me perhaps because of its historical setting. It started out well, but i soon tired of the Italien phrases, such as ""mia madre"" and ""mia zia"" That got really annoying. Also, the Hero was very violent and cagey at first then suddenly got tender and mushy towards the end. It was disconcerting. Ms. Feehan seems to have a preference for characters with dark hair and eyes. I need a little more variety, please! Ms. Feehan also writes her main female characters to fight desperately for their independence throughtout the book, knowing that they will not end against their brooding, possessive Hero. I get tired of the constant whining and carrying on. But it seems that the females also go through some magical personality transformation after the first sex scene. I know sex is good, but come on. Overall, I liked the story even it did bog down in a few places, and i hated the main female's name, Nicoletta. reminds of all those stop-cigarette-smoking commercials."
313.4."Different but still great Though I still favor the carpathian series I really enjoyed this book. Christine Feehan still kept some of her supernatural writing which made this book stand out from others that write mystery romance. Her men are still wonderfully stubborn, know what they want and get it. Her women in her stories are still head strong, not whiny and give the men a challenge. I recommend this book to anyone , I finished it in 2 days. Now lets get back to the carpathian series, this only wets your appetite for more Christine Feehan books!!!!"
314.2."I really wish i hadn't wasted my time First, let me say, I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now."
315.5."The Scarletti curse This is a one to keep. Wonderfull story and plot. Full of dialogue between main characters with a sizzling romance. The plot keeps you turning the pages wanting more. Once again an excellent author."
316.5."the scarletti curse this book was great.Like all of christine feehan's books,it holds your interest at every turn until the bitter end. you did not know who the perpetrator was until the bitter end.it held you on the edge of your seat to see if nicoletta was going to be seriously hurt or killed as were the scarletti brides."
317.5."WOW! My favorite of all time....Giovanni intrigued me soo much...i felt his love for nicoletta soo much i envied her..well written. GOOD WORK CHRISTINE"
318.3."Carpathian Lite This book read a little too much like a toned down book from her Dark series for me to really enjoy it. Like the men in her other series the hero is laboring under a dark shadow and needs that special one woman to make his life light. He is over protective and dictatorial and the woman can't help but want him. The fact that the curse was healed with a little pop psychology did not help the book either. It is still a pleasurable read but it is not one I wanted to repeat."
319.3."Not her best, but not the worst either... I am realtively new to Christine Feehan, and have really enjoyed all of her ""Dark"" series. This was the first gothic novel I've read in quite some time. I must say that while the book was diverting, it was not one of my favorites by Feehan. I didn't find Nicoletta to be all that sympathetic. There were also a lot of minor characters with many names that the reader has to keep straight.Also, while Nicoletta's supernatural powers were explained pretty well, one never really gets to understand why Giovanni has them, or where they come from.But, all of that being said, it was creepy and certainly kept me reading. I was still thinking about the book this morning as I woke up, so that's something. While I wouldn't recommend this book as being one of her best, it is certainly an entertaining read."
320.2."Couldn't finish it I really like Christine Feehan. This book was very dissapointing. The plot had promise. Nicoletta was a sweet heroine. The prose were good, and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace. However, the plot flows like molasses in January. I managed to get half way through before I through the book down and went back to the 'Dark' series."
321.3."Alright 1. The Camera is esay to use, simple which makes it great for use at anytime.2. The Camera is stylish and not at all heavy.3. For connecting to your PC it's easy and works great.4. Price is great, not too expensive.5. Disappointment: The pictures are really pixeled and not at all that clear, even at close distances. Even still shots, aren't that clear. I'm not sure if this is related to the PIXELA program or not. Also I have to import the movie and then the sound which makes it hard to even make a 1 minute movie, then edit the sound into the movie and having it come together in unison.In conclusion: The one most important thing is missing, a clear picture. This is the reason many of us bought this. To capture the smile, laugh, or action of a loved one."
322.5."Great Cam! I love it! it is a great quality camera and does alot of stuff. It even hooks up to my computer and lets me do alot of stuff. I can edit videos or copy them off and even stream video like a web cam its great! Works well with WinXP. I bought from Amazon and they got it to me quickly even with the super saver shipping and the lowest price I could find with a free bag who can ask for more!"
323.4."USB Streaming This is a great camera. I had an older Sony camera which I used Dazzle to bring my video to the PC. When I heard this camera had USB steaming I was excited. The quality and the images are really poor. It produces a very blocky MPEG-1 movie. There is also a post processing time in which PIXELLA converts the movie to MPEG. Dazzle USB brings in my movies faster with no post processing time, it also produces a MPEG-1 movie. Dazzle only pushes video through the USB and uses your sound card to bring in sound. This is in contrast to USB Streaming which pushs video and sound through the USB. I guess because of this architecture, the video bitrate must be lower because it is shared with the sound and thus produces a lower quality image.Other than that, the camera is excellent."
324.2."Poor support I've had the camcorder for a while now, and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas. Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money."
325.3."loved it when it worked... get an ext. warranty on this one I've had two of these, and both of them lasted about a year? Both of them had the same malfunction- tapes jamming in the camera. I talked to a repair shop & they see this a lot with sonys because of the design. Using purchased movie software we were able to make good movies in our pc & burn to dvd. Using pixela software included we could capture still shots (good enough for listing things on ebay, etc.) which was a novelty then!"
326.3."Great camera, but missing important feature This is a great camera. We use it a lot. I love the night shot, the steady shot works great and it has a lot of other nice features. Everything on it works great all the time. The light metering and auto focus work very well too.There is only one problem that really frustrates me. It has a right and a left microphone and records in stereo, but there is no way to get stereo playback through the analog A/V output. That's certainly one of the cheapest things I've seen in products that I've bought. It's very disapointing from a name like Sony."
327.4."Great for the money The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available."
328.2."Low resolution and poor quality I bought it new in 2002 for $400. The color is pretty good. The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes. I didn't use it a lot for the first 3 years, only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time. Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now. I don't know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter's piano class."
329.5."Great primer on Bar Coding This is a great book for anybody who wants to understand what bar codes are, how they work, how to prepare a cost/benefit analysis and how to implement bar codes. Even if it is called Using Bar Codes in Distribution, it is as relevant for other applications.There are a some redundancies in this book that would need to be fixed in a reeddition. Also it would be nice if a reedition was done since it dates from 2000 and technology has evolved so much. But still, even without these improvements it is a great book."
330.2."Okay but Messy.... We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes."
331.4."Cruel and Unusual Cruel and Unusual is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have got read and I for one loved it and I can't wait the read more of her books my boyfriend told me about Patricia Cornwell books he said I need to read Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross and those will be my next two book I will be reading and I will be reading them on my new IPad I got for Christmas I can't wait keep up the great writing Patricia and thanks to my boyfriend for telling me about this awesome writer.........RKsbabydoll"
332.5."Cruel & Unusual Received the book promptly and in great condition. Thank you Amazon for the opportunity to buy used books."
333.3."Semi-Gory Crime Novel with Daring Lack of Love Interest This novel has both a good plot and some decent characterisation. It's gory, but not too gory, and the twists and the turns in the plot make it difficult to put down. In addition, the fact that there is no love interest makes it refreshingly different (the 'no' in 'no love interest' will be somewhat qualified by a reading of the novel), and the centrality of an aunt-niece relationship sub-plot just adds to the value, in my opinion.If you like crime fiction, and if a novel with a coroner as the main character/narrator would appeal to you - try this book."
334.3."so - so first i have to say this is the first book i have read of PC. I was ready to dive into a new author. the story was awesome, the plot thickened, people she knew were getting killed and she id to blame, so it looked then....the killer was WHO? he wasnt introduced until the end of the book - i felt it was a poor ending and i was very disappointed when read who DUNIT! i can understand the reason Jennifer had to die but why Heath and where is Ben????? a lot of loose ends i thought. i am going to read another and thenmake my judgement of her as a writer it was nailbiting until the last 3 pages. Lucy seems like a whiney brat."
335.1."2/3 of a great book, then... blah I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?"
336.4."Great page turner I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point. If the ending was written differently I would have given it 5 stars, but it was still fun to read."
337.3."A lot can happen in a year..... Mark's dead?!!?? Since he was Kay's lost/found love, I guess I would have expected more than a two paragraph explanation of what happened. I assume Kay will have a new love interest in a future book - let's just hope he fairs better than Mark did.Why did Kay move? How did she quit smoking (being an ex-smoker myself - I would be interested in reading the withdrawal symptoms of a medical examiner)? Any reconciliation attempts between Marino and his wife?How can so many people hack into Kay's files? Is it usual in an ME's position to have so many people against/after you (I don't recall Quincy having this much trouble)?The story line was good. The medical portions are morbidly interesting (that is a good thing). I miss the human element. Kay gave the reader more reaction with Abby's death from the previous novel than with the death of a man (Mark) that she has loved/hated for most of her adult life."
338.2."formula type writing My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite."
339.3."Forensically beautiful, yet disappointing, The characters are so wooden and there is so much innuendo as to whose relationship is with or to whom. My first Scarpetta novel was ""TRACE"" so I wanted to go back and read and earlier one. A fan recommended this one. But I still found the characters not particularly likeable. I can't stand Lucy.The plot was excellent and the forensic evidence pieces flawless. But there are so many holes and unconnected dots. And the whole plot changes from being about a killer, and who is killing these people and why to Scarpetta getting out of the accusations. I found the ending somewhat disappointing, not enough clear focus on Waddell and what exactly was going on there. All the focus was on the case against Scarpetta."
340.5."Cruel & Unusual, was fabulous! Cruel and Unusual was another wonderful story by Ms. Cornwell. It was graphic in its detail but I stayed rivited to the end. I read everything she writes. None of it is boring and her knowledge of investigative procedures adds to the thrills of her stories."
341.4."This author has a way of keeping you interested. Marilyn DH Cornwall is a great author and in this book she starts out with a great plot. Just when your interest might be slipping, the story builds"
342.4."Cornwell must have gotten tired of writing this book The first 75% of this book is a 10. Cornwell sets up the perfect novel, albeit with her rather drab, reactive protagonist, but then suddenly swerves off the road and goes bonkers. For me the peak of the book was when Kay Scarpetta is threatened by the governor and is suspended from her job, but then Cornwell finds a way to tie this great, believable plot into, of all things, a Nazi war criminal, and that's where she totally lost me. Then there's absolutely no climax or showdown whatsoever. We just hear about the acts of the murderer second hand, and that was a big letdown, too"
343.4."It must be hard for Cornwell to follow her own work. A superb 'next in series' not to be skipped over. Great plot although I thought it came together too neatly at the conclusion. The author's ingenuity and thought processes have made both Cornwell and Dr. Scarpetta reading buddies of mine. You will love this novel if forensics and mysteries thrill you. I guarantee you will enjoy not only this one but the entire series."
344.5."LOVED IT!!! I love reading all of her books I have read a few in the past, now I am going back and starting from the beginning and reading in order."
345.5."Ronnie Joe Waddell meets the electric chair ... or does he? If you enjoy medical thrillers, you will enjoy this book. It is evident that Cornwell does her research on her subject & you gain useful information as you read."
346.1."I guess it was a mystery In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia."
347.3."Cruel and Unusual I'm an audio book fan, I prefer unabridge and this was abridge and the story just doesn't flow. All of a sudden your in one area and then jump to another.Second, if your downloading to an ipod, the tracks for the three disk are the same so you can't download. In these times for a publisher to play those games is just being lazy.Chuck"
348.3."Audio Cassette Review The book was much better. The abridgement was too much and took too much away from the story so that you never got a sense of the characters. It was like they set out to make it a specific length and hacked away until they could just give you a plot synopsis. I gave the book ****."
349.4."Solid Addition to the Series Like the ones before, this book is a solid forensic and police procedural. A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene. How could that have happened? I particularly enjoyed seeing Kay's niece, Lucy, again, as she is 17 now and her own person, no longer a child. Lucy's computer skills continue to amaze. I look forward to reading the next in the series!(Note: There is a continuing bad guy introduced in this book who appears in the next two installments as well. I'd recommend reading this book before The Body Farm and From Potter's Field)"
350.4."CORNWELL CRUD Patricia Cornwell is very clearly a well researched writer. She really knows her stuff when it comes to forensics. This ability of hers is reflected in the character of Kay Scarpetta, medical examiner. I kept reading in order to find out the links among the deaths of Robyn Naismith, Eddie Heath, Susan, and Jennifer Deighton. Most of my questions were answered, but I felt that there was WAY too much forensic evidence for my liking, and really did not enjoy this book."
351.5.Cruel and Unusual Cruel and UInusalPatricia is an excellent writter and I love her books, but she sometimes leaves you a bit flat at the ending of the book
352.2."Muddled ending disapoints The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw."
353.5."Very nice book I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel."
354.3."A Medieval Murder Trial A King is honoring a nobleman, yet an accuser comes forward and accuses the nobleman of murder. The accuser is put into jail. They plan to execute the accuser. The King has a supporter, a crooked abbot, who plots against the accuser. A ghost of the murder victim appears here and there to somehow explain the injustice and that leads the accuser to be thought to be involved in sorcery. That is the book in a nut shell! A Medieval Murder Trial. Not the usual Ann Radcliffe but the book is interesting and I recommend it!"
355.4."MUCH SMARTER THAN THE TITLE LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE! I enjoyed 'Funny People' because it wasn't the typical silly comedy that has come out in over abundance lately. The film is much more serious than silly with good performances by all and has a sense of reality and truth throughout the story. Sandler leaves his goofy bag at home and lets his character become a more likeable and interesting person. The film avoids the many pitfalls of such films and leaves you satisfied and wanting more of these types of films. If you're looking for an insightful film with some good laughs, you'll probably like 'Funny People' but it you're looking for the usual Sandler shtick, you might want to pass on this one."
356.1."Soooooooooooo NOT Funny This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage."
357.1."Nasty People! Nasty Film! Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film."
358.2."Dramedy This movie was perhaps Adam Sandler's worst effort. He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic, but he came across as being apathetic about the role. The result was that his performance never engaged viewers to want to pull for him, which made the climax of the film lackluster. It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama. Despite all the big names and cameo appearances, the only real stand out was Leslie Mann, who plays Sandler's ex. She was the only lively force in the cast, but sadly, alone she wasn't enough to bring it back into focus. You're not missing a thing."
359.1."UNFUNNY PEOPLE I used to enjoy Sandler's movies but this one is just....jeez, how to put it? Well, UNFUNNY.All characters are if not stupid, shallow and egotistical...Don't care how 'dramatic' was this supposed to be, his misogynistic prick persona is the worst ever. Just, don't watch it, really...You'll want those minutes from your life back."
360.1."I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this. I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude ""jokes"". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing."
361.2."Long, somewhat dull and unfocused This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. First of all it's not funny. It's about ""comedy"" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself to be a comedy, although there are a few funny things in it I suppose. This movie seems like it's all over the place. It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me."
362.5."Apatow's Depth Triumphs I am a stand-up fanatic. I enjoy the alternative comedians and the culture that have been cultivating in NY and LA lately. I consume the content of stand-ups like C.K., Cross, Tompkins, Glass, Jeselnik, Ansari, Posehn, Miller, and Holmes-to name a few. If you lean that way in your comedy preferences then my review will likely be applicable to you.I love this movie. You must go into it not knowing what to expect i.e. don't assume you know the movie will have the same feeling as knocked up. The characters are hilarious in their struggles and their actors are superb. Great director, great cast, and a hell of an perspective on alternative comedy.Lastly, buy the collector's edition. The bonus features are endless! If the film brings you down and you consequently reflect negatively on yourself, worry not, the second disc will right you. Just read the disc content and you'll be sold. Enough said."
363.2."WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY? Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying ""tweet"" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you."
364.4."Underrated This is by far Judd Apatow's most underrated movie. I think that most people went into it expecting the typical Apatow fare, but were disappointed when they realized it was one of the filmmaker's more mature efforts. The film has its share of laughs, as well as moments of sincere drama. Just put yourself in that mindset, and you'll really enjoy this movie."
365.2."Starts out with promise, but then goes downhill. Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script. Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes. There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts. Maybe it is a marketing problem. Or, maybe just lazy writing. Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian. Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama."
366.2."Not so Funny people! Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. I don't think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow's ensemble doesn't seem to work with Sandler's schtick. I loved ""Knocked Up"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin"" but there doesn't seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for ""Bruno"" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I'm so glad I only rented it."
367.3."Har Har ........not funny What we have here is a pretty good movie for what it is. But do we want to seea unfunny Adam Sandlers, that what we get here. I think Adam might be going inthe right direction with more serious acting, but calling this movie Funnypeople, you expect a movie to be more funny.Seth Rogen is quite a character, him and his friends do add some characterto this movie. But by the end, it felt like i just finished a TV movie without the commercials....So for what it is, its good, but not a keeper."
368.3."Interesting but... Too many dick jokes and it was too long. But like Entourage, it was interesting to see what life is like for a celebrity. We always think that people who are rich and famous have it all but clearly, that's not true."
369.1."Not what I expected... I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/"
370.1."Absolutely NOTHING Funny ! This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
371.3."Not Sandlers best. I guess I just look for Sandlers movies to be a bit better but this one to me just fell short.Some of it was funny but overall I just found it all lacking."
372.1."The L O N G E S T movie... EVER! Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD."
373.1."Seth Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!! A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian."
374.1."Stupid.... Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!"
375.1."Sandler's worst! I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this."
376.1."waste of time I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching."
377.1."Moron How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM."
378.4."Not entirely a comedy I am big fan of Judd Apatow's work. i went into this hearing that its not like his other movies, that it has a more somber, serious tone. so my expectations were tempered. I liked it, i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long, which is why I take off one star. But if you go in knowing this isnt a 40 year old virgin/knocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed. with that being said, i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in."
379.1."Winning Cast, movie fell short This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre."
380.1."ACTUALLY NO STARS for rating pf Funny People movie Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL."
381.1."Not Funny People Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;"
382.4."A Surprisingly Good Film I was prepared to be disappointed, wasting another 2 hours of my life on yet another cookie cutter Hollywood product. The movie, while about half an hour too long, was quite entertaining, making you feel privy to the inner workings of the strange world of Hollywood. It was well written, funny, but not immature, at least not more immature than the actions of the characters, which felt real rather than scripted. Overall, a strong addition to the recent spate of good, mature comedies coming out of Hollywood - I am thinking Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Hall Pass, etc."
383.5."Lovely! This is just a wonderful graphic novel with beautiful illustrations, an interesting story set in a different culture. I had not been a fan of graphic novels, but this was one of those that have convinced me that they can, like opera, enhance the experience by using a fusion of art forms. I highly recommend it."
384.5."A Masterpiece! Meet the first reconstructionist cat and rabbi from Algeria Safr's beautifully illustrated tale of a traditional rabbi who loses his faith in the face of colonial assimilation and a secular cat who tells the tale is on the level of Will Eisner's Contract With God and Art Speigelman's Maus. American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history? He is the first writer, I believe, to have a street-smart house cat answer this question. Rabbi Daniel S. Brenner, Director, Center for Multifaith Education, Auburn Theological Seminary, NYC."
385.4."Thought provoking This was a book club selection and, at first, I thought it was simply a comic book. Wrong. This is a charming, thought provoking little book that can be read at many different levels. No wonder my rabbi was the one who suggested that we read this. If you understand the basics of Judiasm, you'll get more out of this book. But even if you are not, you will be charmed by this fanciful tale."
386.1."Unpleasant and disappointing This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!"
387.1."Self-Serving Message This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."
388.1."Not what it looks like on the cover. As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book."
389.5."Fascinating yet tragic This was such and interesting book to read. It's about the one person who was the closest witness to the assassination of President Kennedy and how she was persecuted and finally redeemed. Namely Jean Hill. Her story needed to be told. It can't be ignored. She was filmed for Oliver Stone's movie titled JFK. She was cut from the theater production, but it is in the director's cut, which is the one you should see. It chronicles what lengths people will go to silence a dissenting witness. If you have ever seen the Zapruder film of the assassination, then you have seen Jean Hill. She was the woman standing on the curb in a red dress at the ""moment""."
390.2."See my article ""Jean Hill - The Lady in Red"" online Since writing my review of JFK: THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998, I have been able to have my 35-page article - ""Jean Hill -The Lady in Red"" - included in Clint Bradford's JFK Assassination website. The address is: http://www.jfk-info.com/sitemap1.htm (scroll down for title)."
391.1."Drivel Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!"
392.1."Fraud,not as advertised This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation."
393.4."Minneapolis Pop Rock indie/emo stuff This is one of the biggest bands in minneapolis right now. Recently added to AP's 100 bands you need to know in 05'. So get to know em before everyone else does. Great great music. For fans of Further Seems Forever, Jimmy Eat World, Death Cab For Cutie.www.purevolume.com/smalltownsburnalittleslower"
394.2."Unsatisfying ending disappoints the reader The plot develops nicely then ends abruptly with an unsatisfying ending. It seems to the reader as if the author had reached her contractual page limit and slapped an ending onto the book. A superhuman villian was terminated too easily. The method of capture was not adequately developed. Several promising themes were not followed up by the author, especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gault's uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation. The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner"
395.2."Kay Scarpetti is losing it. Here is a character I have enjoyed develop. But Kay is losing it. She should dump her niece Lucie, clean up her personal life (it's not nice to have an affair with a friends husband) and treat Det. Marino with some respect.As for Gault, if I pick up another Scarpetti book with his name in it... right back on the shelf"
396.1."If you can't say anything nice, Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story"
397.1."You have GOT to be kidding This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists."
398.2."Disappointment at it's extreme I had never read this author, but knew of many who did. When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work. Now, I pray that the screen does so.I was extremely disappointed with this work. It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author."
399.3."Riveting! Don't let the first quarter of this book discourage you. I thought it was slow, cliched and I almost ditched it, and would leave it in my handbag to read on the train to work if I was really bored. But as I kept reading it on train, I realized eventually, I could not put it down; I had to know what would happen next, as with all good mysteries. I ended up reading it not only on the train but through the night at home, I just had to know what happended! Great mystery and the main character, the Medical Examiner, Scapetta, (which is very important when I read a book) is someone with credibility and that you care about what happens to."
400.2."Losing her edge? I loved Patricia Cornwell's first five novels; sadly, her sixth loses its edge.. I wanted to enjoy it.. but the plot labors on.. and I had a hard time finishing a book I couldn't wait to read. We lose Scarpetta's forensic ""grit"" and instead focus on a bizarre, rather boring computer plot.. I hope the next books in the series are better!"
401.4."good book compare to others For a first book that I read from this author it keeps your interest and give a lot of forensic pathology when describing what is going."
402.5."Dr. Scarpetta Returns, and So Does Gault! Prepare to keep the lights on tonight if you're reading ""From Potter's Field""! Enter the dark, even sometimes humorous, world of Dr.Kay Scarpetta, a mystery solving sleuth where you don't expect it! Marino better watch out for his job.Suspense and terror reign through ""Potter's Field"" as well as suprise and intrigue. We once again encounter the evil Temple Gault and seek the identity of his latest victim. Its like mixing horror and mystery and getting the best of both worlds!If you didn't read this book on hardcover, pick it up now on paperback! Unless, of course, you chicken.."
403.3."good reading but too much like other books reading this book reminds me of the other books she has written. Cornwell is an excellent writer who needs to remember that she should change her characters once in a while. We are lead slowly down a path to the inevitable outcome. The only twist in this book is the sister who looks like him. It's a good read"
404.2."So far, the worst book of one of my favorite authors Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was very disappointed about her latest achievment. Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasn't her best idea. Even more disturbing: The characters of her main heros (Scarpetta, Marino, Lucie) were described inconsistent with her previous books"
405.5."Great book. Not as spell binding as others in this series but still very good. It took getting to the last couple of chapters to understand the title, but that was minor. I also found a alot of typos in this book. usually just minor ones but a name was completely wrong, but correct in the very next sentence. I had to stop for a second and think....who is that? ok...off to Amazon.com to find the next one."
406.5."scarpetta this book is amazing. it was an all around exciting book. scarpetta definetly meets my expectations. it was a roller coster of emotions. i couldnt put the book down. i will re-read this book numerous times."
407.3."Hey! Wait a minute! I really enjoyed this story and the writing very much -- until I got to the end. The events that bring us to the climax are intriguing and shocking (and grisly, as a warning to anyone not familiar with Cornwell). The interpersonal relationships among the ""good guys"" -- Kay, Benton, Marino, Janet and Lucy -- added texture and enhanced the suspense. And I enjoyed moving from Virginia to New York to Hilton Head with Kay. BUT this ending! So much action brings us to a very unsatisfying climax. Throughout the book, we hear at least two characters muse as to why the villain behaves as he does. This made me want to hear a definitive answer. And we never get it. The book ends so abruptly, you would think Ms. Cornwell simply ran out of paper."
408.3."She's Done Better Having read six of Cornwell's novels I have to say that this isn't presented with the momentum and irony that her other books had. The first fourth of the book is excellent, but then the ending is so disappointing that you wonder why she even bothered with the foreshadowing. I enjoyed this book, but it could have been better."
409.5."One of the best mysteries I've read in a while It was magnificent. I picked it up at a Border's bookstore for 3 dollars just to see how it was. ever since I've read it I've been stuck on her books. It was great a little gory at parts but it had a wonderful storyline and plot. I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves mysteries."
410.3."Suspenseful but uneventful ending I enjoyed it very much particularly the written skills in describing the characters and the crime scenes. However, I was not convinced about the ending since it did not explain about why Temple Gault was challenging Dr.Scarpetta. Perhaps a book on his adolescent and how he develops an emotional attachment to Kay would be interesting."
411.3."awful Mystery novels are the only books that I read and this one was the worst book I've read this year. I was expecting more from Ms. Cornwell."
412.2."What a disappointment! I expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a well-seasoned author. The plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed. The only reason I continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as I read. Boy, was I disappointed."
413.4."Good Enough I have read almost all of Patricia Cornwell's series with Kay Scarpetta and if you liked her other books, you will probably enjoy this book as well. It has the same feel as the others except I find the adultery that Kay continues to commit inconsistent with her strict sense of right and wrong. Marino is always a great character you can easily picture in your mind and I found the scene with the police at the morgue particularly good. The ending was a bit of a let down. However, I'm still hooked and will continue to read her books."
414.1."A wildly implausible thriller This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the ""intrigue"" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out."
415.3."Predictable but Good Most of the story you could have guessed at and unless you were deaf, dumb and blind you were not really shocked as to how the story ended.Still not a bad little book. I would recommend it. I still like Dr. Kay even after all this time."
416.3."Entertaining, but one major quibble. I listened to the tape version, which is pretty good for getting you to the beach, etc. There is a strong narrative drive that carries you along. However, having the text read to you highlights some of the lack of ""tightness"" that good editing could have fixed. Also, please don't TELL us that Gault is the worst murderer of the century, SHOW us. Prove it! My personal quibble is that when our heroine is talking with a woman's father and he asks if his daughter is dead, Kay answers with a flat yes, when at most she's got a hunch as to the identity of the dead woman. This is inconceivable for a forensic pathologist whose specialty is not only what she knows, but what she can prove. I'd probably listen to another Scarpetta book on tape, if I got it from the library."
417.3."Cornwell's ""From Potter's Field"" The first 90% of the story held my interest. In the last 50 pages it seemed that Miss Cornwell ran out of steam. It had a let's-get-this-done anti-climatic aire. I expected a thrilling pursuit through the subways of New York, complete with frustrating near misses and near successes. Instead, we get bad guy just comes straight to the heroine, temporarily captures heroine #2, is thwarted by heroine and disabled, all in 20 or so pages."
418.2."Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believability This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read. She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story."
419.3."Good...up until the end! I was really into this book and was having a hard time putting it down. But the end left me totally unstatisfied. I felt that it was rushed and really left no closure, almost like there were pages misssing from my book that would compliment the story. It was as if the author was faced with constraints in time or space. Great story line...bad ending."
420.1."No one will edit this, because I'm Patricia Cornwell At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G."
421.2."To contrived and therefore not plausible I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it."
422.4."The end of Gault in a satisfying thriller The is one of Scarpetta's better adventures. Temple Brooks Gault, the serial killer released from prison in ""Cruel & Unusual"" plays mind games with Scarpetta and the NYPD and NY Transit Police after a woman's body is discovered in a park. The twisty plot is worth a re-read, especially for the ending which pits Gault against Scarpetta and her geniuse niece, Lucy, in the subway tunnels of New York."
423.5.Scarpetta rocks! I love the Kay Scarpetta series, that's how I got hooked on the whole forensics stuff! Patricia Cornwell is an excellent author!
424.4."First Cornwell read, entertaining and fast paced This was my first Cornwell book. I enjoyed the characters in this story and I look forward to reading more about Scarpetta, Marino, Benton and company. The action was fluid and I was never sure where Gault, our killer, was going to turn up next.Cornwell is detailed and this lends credibility to the plot and circumstances. The events are gruesome, but this is a coroner we are reading about, so that is to be expected. Cornwell does not exhaust the reader with gore and that made the subject matter easier to handle.The one criticism I do have is that the story moved so fast that I felt I was sometimes missing something. I think I just have to get used to Cornwell's writing style, and I maybe should have started the series in a chronological order. Nonetheless, a satisfying read, and I would recommend the Cornwell series to others, worthy of 4 stars."
425.5."Hoping for more! Adermatt grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept it to the end. She tells an extremely poignant and relevant story such that I felt I was watching every minute of it in real life. I hope this is the beginning of a series!"
426.3."Funny, but not many Coloured Diagrams I was a little disappointed with this. Though I enjoyed John's humour as always, there is a decided lack of coloured art. I remember purchasing a ""Bloom County"" book of cartoons back in the 1980's - and large portions of the book were in colour. But the reverse is true here. There are some illuminated sketches, but the great majority of the book is black and white. Half the fun of Mr. McPherson's work is witnessing the funny pictures, and the lack of colour interfers with this. I would like publishers, as part of the book description, to include an accounting of the amount or percentage of hued work."
427.1."A Piece of Crap! Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!"
428.1."No theory what so ever The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice"
429.4."good book for beginners I am from Germany and was in the US for studying Economics. That book is very easy written and explains good. For classes it is required. A bit too expensive and too heavy to carry. Quite good."
430.1."wrong item I was going to get a book with a ISN number of 0072316373...But today, I got one with 0070412901...So I need you send my money beac to my account, and give me a well reason why you let the seller mail me a totally different book again, It is the second time I get an item with wrong number"
431.4."Very interesting read I picked up this book not realizing that I had already read excerpts from it in another of Childress' books. I was headed for Jordan and was interested in reading up on Petra when I found this book. As I read more, it began to get really interesting. His broad coverage of various theories of ancient civilizations is fascinating, if sometimes hard to believe. But, that being said, there are so many unexplained civilizations out there that, however fanciful the explanations may be, who knows, some may even be correct!! It's an entertaining read, and really causes you to reconsider some very basic historical facts that may turn out to be in error. How DID those guys at the Temple of Ba'al move 2 million pound stones?!? Makes you wonder!!"
432.4."Lincoln in a new light ""Lincoln Reconsidered"" by David Donald 1961History has always been an interest for me. This takes a bit of time and expands on it very nicely. It starts out with a nice introdution about Lincoln and his times, the people he knew and worked with, then goes onto the politics and war. It had some anecdotes that you never see anywhere else. It turns out that Linoln was not a rabid emancipationist, but a pratical president who did things as needed to be done. I wondered before why he only freed the slaves in the states in rebellion: it was because he did not want to alienate the slaveholders in Kentucky and Maryland. I am still mystified as to the reason for the war of northern aggression: slavery does not seem to be the all inclusive answer that mythology makes it out to be, and this book shows some altenative reasons, but does not take a stand, after it is only a collection of essays."
433.4."Available for Free You can get the full text of the 1952 edition free here: [...]Information is costly, so hopefully you read the review."
434.3."Hard to read I am not a native speaker but have no problem understanding the popular books on economy. Not this one. I am still struggling with the style so I cannot fully judge the content of it yet.In my opinion, an author that writes for general public (that is for whom the book was intended, I assume) should try to simpify the writing style.And for that reason I gave it 3 stars."
435.5."a brilliant, well-written economics primer Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the ""common good."" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."
436.3."book This is an interesting read and reflects the perspective of the author in its title, ""Economics in One Lesson . . . """
437.3."To review this book I haven't finished book, but I perceived it is written years and years ago, does it fit the global eco circumstance ? And the expression is not straightforward, but I'll keep going, from all aspects to get an idea how people understand economy. Thank you."
438.2."Don't waste your money. If you are new to Economics, this is one book that you can skip. It is not useful nor ""mandatory reading"" if you are looking to understand the subject better. There is not even one chart or graph included in this book!!! Stick with Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science or Economics for Dummies as these two titles will serve you better."
439.3."Set your expectations before you buy this The value of this book depends on what you expect out of it. I bought this book so I can get a good idea about basic economics in general not about government economic policies. But this book essentially goes about picking one government policy after another (like tax cuts, protection of industries, price fixations, minimum wage etc) and goes about telling us why such artificial measures are not right and why the economy should in general be left to free market forces.As such, the book was a kind of disappointment for me - in not meeting my requirements. Though I should say that by itself, the contents of the book are quite good and generally enlightening."
440.2."More of a personal opinion than that of economics When I read something I like the whole story with some facts to back them up, but what I got out of this book was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion. Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book."
441.3."A Political pamphlet all the way This book seems to be a political pamphlet, all the way. I like the narrative approach though. Too much anger at the government I guess. Analysis please. Reader will draw their own conclusions."
442.3."Good for the person that hasn't studied economics The book is good for the person that hasn't studied economics. It reflects the libertarian philosophy of low taxes and self sufficiency."
443.2."Polemic and Outdated I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have ""the answer,"" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general."
444.2."This ain't no economics book! I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics."
445.3."Ho-hum Mr. Hazlitt had some good points to offer, but there were two things that were diminishing: much of his content was dated (written a half-century ago) and he dwelt on certain issues in far too much detail. I was disappointed."
446.3."Biased / not a general intro to economics If you want someone to argue against Keynes, then this book is for you. I know enough to know that economic stimulus during a recession is considered reasonable by many (but not all) economists."
447.5."Never more needed than today Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and ""higher education"" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."
448.5."Economics even you will Understand For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope"
449.5."Our Senators and Reps should read and heed This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.I liked it; I could read and understand it."
450.4."Exellent Why was I not taught this in school. An excellent book whose lessons still hold true today. I highly recommend it."
451.5."A common sense approach to Economics Economics in One Lesson is essentially an introduction into the Austrian school of Economic thought. Hazlitt's now renowned treatise originally written in 1946 is lauded by Libertarian stalwarts Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and Lew Rockwell among others. While some of the examples provided in the text may be dated the book is as relevant today as it was when first written. Hazlitt, from a 1940's perspective, takes on many of today's most controversial issues such as government spending, taxes, minimum wage, balance of trade, unions and inflation. In an era of big government, many of Hazlitt's economic lessons come as a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend Economics in One Lesson for those interested in learning about the Austrian School of economics and basic free market priciples."
452.1."Unsatisfactory and very outdated I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's."
453.1."Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice."
454.4."Economics demystified I read this book in college (some 50 years ago), and it's basic precepts have stuck with me all those years, and have helped me reduce complex issues to fundamental truths. You won't find details of the complexities of all of today's problems, but it will help you better understand them and give you a strong starting point from which to approach them, and to brush aside all the political BS that surrounds them. Politicians and economists-all of them-like to surround their public positions with their own idealogy. This book will help sort out the core issues. You might still agree with the ideology, but at least you will know it when you depart from the basics."
455.5."Changed my life I know it sounds stupid. I know it sounds extreme. I know it sounds ridiculous.But this book REALLY DID change my life.I used to be a bleeding-heart liberal: ""the government has to do X, Y and Z"".This book showed me how wrong I was. How so VERY wrong I was.This book should be mandated reading in all schools."
456.5."Criticizing what you don't understand I have to laugh at the negative reviews of this book. They are probably written by socialists who don't understand economics, otherwise they wouldn't be socialists. Hazlitt's arguments are based on (1) a real understanding of economics and (2) facts, including that socialism has been an abject failure where ever it has been tried. In contrast, the arguments of modern liberals are based on emotions and are devoid of facts and of thinking about the world as it is.I can tell you that this is one of the very best books that has ever been written on economics."
457.4."A good libertarian primer This book is a little outdated, and a little heavy on the libertarianism, but otherwise it's a very easy read, and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas."
458.4."Not a 5 star, but close The book is extremely too cryptic for normal readers. I had the toughest time understanding all the extremely complicated language in this book. It would be nice for it to have been made for ""dummies"", but I still got it. Austrian economics needs to be taught in school, period."
459.5."Worth the brain power This may be the only hardcore economics book I've really ever read. I don't follow through on many books period, but I pushed on through this one. The effort was valuable and worth it. From what I understand, it's held as one of the classics and rightly so. Just take it in chunks as you have time, but do yourself a favor and glean some knowledge from this one."
460.5."Lives up to the hype Amazingly prophetic book. Could have been written yesterday. So far, a very educational read. I can see why so many people are recommending this book."
461.5."Understanding the philosophy of economics These concepts are important for everyone to familiarize themselves with. I teach economics and it has been incredibly helpful to use these illustrations with my students. Such simple and easy to read chapters. Read one a day and really think about each one. Before you know it the financial reports and the governments budgeting process will come clearly into view. You will begin thinking in the micro and the macro with ease. If it makes sense in your home, it will most likely make sense on the national level.I highly recommend this easy to read little book. Learn these concepts and see what new world will open up for you in so many areas."
462.1."over-simplified diatribe Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free."
463.1."A historical gem whose title obscures its intent Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action."
464.1."More politics, less economincs I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house."
465.1."This book's title is misleading. This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase."
466.1."Straight to the trash can! Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!"
467.3."Nice to finally see some P:TL merchandise! It was a bit on the short side but enjoyable to finally get to read the first P:TL novel - it read like I was watching an episode ! :-) Nick got to do his Navy SEAL/action thing which I'm sure his fans will appreciate. However, I would've liked to have seen the team *together* instead of working separately as the writers of the series were always doing to them in the last two seasons. MAJOR peeve (and this wasn't just me, I heard it from other fans) was the way the Legacy House was referred to with the ""the"" (or ""the San Francisco"") in front of it. I'm looking forward to the next P:TL novel that comes out from this publisher."
468.5."A very accessible mathematical classic An excellent and lucid exposition of what we really mean when we talk about 2 houses, or 1/2 an hour, or square root of 2 meters, or that the counting numbers are infinite. It does not require any prior mathematical knowledge beyond the basics, although it probably will be of interest only to those that care about math at its most abstract. It is fascinating to realize how much we take for granted when we do math and how much ingenuity it takes to pin down the concept of number. Highly recommended."
469.4."Kids love it It's Thomas! Kids love it. I can tolerate him better than Barney or those Wiggles. Still sounds so odd to hear George Carlin narrating a children's movie..."
470.4."great book of chocolate I ordered this book several years ago to do a paper. Yes, it is good enough to use as a reference for a college level paper. On a less serious note, it is also entertaining to read for chocolate lovers, and even though I completed my paper and class a long time ago, we still have this book."
471.5."A delicious presentation indeed, packed with history and appeal Chocolate makers and company evolution are the focus of a tasty selection of historical notes in Beth Kimmerle's Chocolate: The Sweet History - but the focus doesn't end with company profiles alone. Historical details trace chocolate's Aztec origins, cocoa plant myths and usage, timelines of chocolate trade development, and more, adding depth and insights which include notes on different varieties of chocolate. Add luscious historical photos and ads in full color and you have a delicious presentation indeed, packed with history and appeal."
472.4."Grew on a second viewing A sort of mix of Percy Adlon's earlier `Bagdad Café' andRoberty Altman's `Three Women' set in Alaska.k.d. lang plays an androgynous miner who falls in love with a straight, private, local German librarian.They both have muddy, tragic pasts that slowly emerge. There are some deeply moving moments,and some wonderful slightly magical realist touches. The cinematography is very good. But while langdoes a surprisingly decent job, I can't help thinking a stronger, more experienced actress could havebrought out even more in this amazing role.That said, I did enjoy this much more on a second viewing. While it bothered me that it felt at times likeAdlon was simply trying to re-create the magic of `Bagdad Café' (odd, surreal setting, quirky out of placecharacters, cinematography that uses color in exaggerated ways for effect, etc.) overall I foundmyself more able to just let go and accept this tale on its own merits. And doing that, it made me smile."
473.2."Too much kid-pop music for a dark, animated movie! I don't like the fact that there was so much kiddie-pop music on the soundtrack,where as the first, second, and third movies had a blend of rock, techno, hip-hop, andrap... but this one had too much kid music for a movie that was (for the most part)dark!The only song on this album that fit the mood of the movies was 'Lights Out' by P.O.D.!That re-mix of the song is the only reason why I bought this album!Not recommended for the whole album, just that one song..."
474.5."Great Camera I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!"
475.4."Great Camcorder I just got the CCD-TRV-308 camcorder and it is awesome!! The only thing is is that you cant edit your film on your computer you can just play it back. I give 4 - 4 1/2 stars"
476.4."Practical and complete I recommend this book because is good to have it on your desk as a quick reference, for those wo are starting into ABAP, can consider to purchase the reference book too, in order to have a vast source to lern from."
477.4."Great Stories but a little repetitive This is a wonderful collection of tales from South America, which won the Newbery Medal 1925. The stories are for all ages and written to intrigue the reader and whisk him or her to a far away land. Brave worriers, fair maidens, rich kings, evil witches, and ferocious giants are all a part of these tales. My only negative comment about this book is that towards the end it became somewhat repetitive. All the characters became somewhat similar and the plots (although diverse) had similar paths. However, this is a great book for children's bedtime stories, and a treat to the adult who reads it to them."
478.2."This book is incomprehensible This book was an anthology of 19 stories. I didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. I had to read almost every paragraph over. I could not comprehend at all!"
479.1."It wasn't very good! This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review."
480.4."Author's comments As the author of this book, I would just like to say that it has been successfully published in the Uk and reached number 60 in the hot one hundred best sellers. It has also sold successfully in Australia, Greece, Italy, America, Japan, Sweden, and is now being published in Poland. In Japan it was so poular that although only published last year it is now being reissued.To Amazon!! Please remove the stars as I do not have the right to rate my own book. I had to put them in so that I could post this as you no longer give the author a right to reply - which I believe you should when bad reviewers slate an author's book.Linda Sole. I write as Anne Herries and Linda Sole."
481.5."Virtually perfect folding table I've received and tried these great tables. I'm sorry I only ordered four. Even though I'm small, I can manage these tables - all 4 by myself! They fit in the back of my SUV and in my camper. My bruiser children have already started using them as a jungle gym/stairmaster -- they are incredibly stable and sturdy. My only concern is the legs don't lock in the folded(collapsed) position. If you hold them vertical it's not a problem, but when rotated, one leg drops - I'm using a canopy bungee to secure the two legs together for transport.Lori"
482.3."My review will be forthcoming if or when I receive this prod I placed my order for this picnic table on July 24 and as yet have not received it.Just keep getting up dated delivery dates."
483.1."on order I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait."
484.5."Super handy on trips we didn't even use the magnetic feature but glad it had that option. Compact, easy to take (about size of Ipad but thicker). Would recommend for the avid backgammon enthusiasts like us who cannot bear to go too long without playing!"
485.4."good for the price We got this for our 8 year old niece for christmas and it was a hit. Quality seems just right for the price. The fact that it's magnetic is great for the kids or for traveling. No complaints."
486.4."Long torso but great product Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. It's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher. The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1"". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans. Not the best for sitting, whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn't do that. The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised."
487.3."Squeem = Squeeze + Scream? This shapewear does exactly what it's supposed to do- squeezes you into a nice shape where you've got a little extra. With a loose-fitting shirt over top, I looked amazing. With a tight-fitting shirt, you could see ripples. Pretty much, if you plan on standing the whole time you're wearing this, it's amazing. If you sit much or bend over a lot, it's not so great because it will ripple and those do not go away. I was constantly trying to smooth it out while standing. So I'm torn because this thing really did make me feel great about how I looked while wearing it, but those ripples were extremely bothersome. You can see a little from the picture that it's not completely smooth on the front and has a few minor ripples, but once you put it on and bend over or sit down, these become much more pronounced and extend to the back. I ended up returning mine because of this, but I also wouldn't steer people away from it because it does such a good job."
488.4."shapewear she liked it and I think it defined her curves an makes her appear alot slimmer. she said it is somewhat tight but also stated she gets used to it after a few minutes."
489.4."Squeeze n Scream! I ordered my size based on the sizing provided. I am able to hook on the first set of hooks. It does provide the curves I was looking for, but I NEVER forget that I have it on. The area below the waist was flipping up the first week that I wore it as I do deskwork all day; lately it hasn't but i don't know if that is due to additional weight loss or the fact that I was wearing clothes that did not allow it to do so! After wearing for several hours, I do experience a little soreness where the stays are pressing against my ribs. The lines of the squeem will show under a close fitting garment if your are near the upper limits of your size; and if someone is holding you, I believe they would be able to feel the support structure."
490.4."Squeem This product is fantastic, got alot of compliments on how much skinnier I looked and it is also comfortable, can wear it for hours. It took me about a day (actually a few hrs) to get comfortable wearing it"
491.3."Odd smell.... Even months after purchasing this and trying a few different methods, I have not been able to rid the shapewear of the ""rubbery"" smell. It is quite difficult and time-consuming to get on and off, and really, the end result really isn't worth the time and effort, especially with the worry that others will detect the awful smell."
492.2."Wasn't what I expected I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point."
493.4."Works Well! I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I ""tried out"" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me ""back fat"" which I do not normally have...I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm. When wearing the cincher you have two ""size options"" with the double hook closure..which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your ""natural"" waist to create a better shape. It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material(def makes you sweaty...but it DOESNT move around) Totally worth it!Kinda painful...the boning pushes into my ""under/side boob"" probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs...(size 36 DD)Ladies, if it helps..I am 5'2 135lbs busty, not super skinny but not fat(size 27 in jeans)"
494.4."Works Well I like the product. Helps trim me down a little under the clothing. The rubber makes you sweat. After a couple days of wearing it, I really do feel trimmer in the middle. The immediate compression isn't as much as my steel boned corsets, but is pretty decent for shapewear. I'd say an inch plus a little more in the areas that need extra smoothing.However, I don't recommend it for all day (10 hour) wear. I'm so itchy by the time I get home. It is cotten on the inside, but it still itches by the end of the day.In terms of fit, I am a 20, usually. Sometimes an 18. I bought a 3XL. It fits fine. I am short and it does indeed go from hip to just under the bust."
495.2."not really worth it I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better."
496.2."Painful Experience I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day. It would've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren't very flexible."
497.3."It works but it hurts It sucked all of me in & I looked great. I wore it for about 4 hours & when I got home & took it off my sides, back, & stomach wouldn't stop itching. By the end of the night I had welps on my sides, which turned into blisters by the next morning. I gave it 3 stars because it did what it was supposed to but I didn't count on the itching, welps or blisters."
498.3."not what I expected Based on the positive reviews, I was excited to receive my cincher. But when it arrived and I tried it on, two things annoyed me: 1) all those hooks! I couldn't imagine struggling with allll those tiny hooks every single time I wore it; 2) it was just too stiff! Sure, it definitely holds you in, but if I were at a party and someone happened to touch my waist, I'd be mortified, knowing they'd just discovered my secret. Besides, I think I'd prefer something a little more breathable. I wanted to love this product, but I just didn't. (I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could, only because it does actually work.)"
499.1."poor fit After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper."
500.2."Gave me a waist, but just pushed my fat around The product did what it was ""supposed to"" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. My waist was super tiny, but above and below (mostly below) I bulged like crazy, so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned. My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod, so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be... I guess this product worked for other ladies, but for me, it just looked really unnatural and odd."
501.4."Great results, with some side effects... I have one of those ""spare tire"" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to ""make"" me look trimmer..."
502.1."Upset I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down..."
503.2."Falling apart When I first received this product I was plenty happy, I thought I had finally (after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher) found the right one. It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to ""right-sized"" eating (whereas a lot of times I would get seconds, I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving), which of course is wonderful. I didn't mind that sometimes it bunched up, I didn't mind that sometimes it left welts (that went away shortly after I removed the cincher), however, after about two weeks, on of the metal prongs came out, making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn't hold it's form. Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost."
504.2."Incrediby difficult to put on With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks."
505.1."Squeem I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,"
506.2."Had to return it The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right. I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy, just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies. I don't like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs. The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesn't feel smooth all over. Squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage. If you do decide to purchase this product it's easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts."
507.5.very good product good quailty i liked this product so much i am going to buy one for my mom and another one in black for me
508.5."Shapewear This is very well made, it came on time and does exactly what it is made to do, I give it 5 stars."
509.3."Not too bad but a bit uncomfy This isn't too bad and stays on pretty well but after some time the ribbing can dig into your skin at the top and bottom and leave red marks. I wear it with a cami underneath and that definitely helps if I wear it long. Size wise I have a 28"" waist and I got the small which on the first set of hooks is tight but not uncomfortably so. It does a good job staying where it is and doesn't ride up or down, but it is not totally seemless nor does it always lay completely flat so itcan be seen under a tight fighting top or dress."
510.4."Good product This waist cincher is pretty good. It's really hard to get latched , but once it's on, it's pretty comfortable. I didn't have any problems with it riding up, or folding over."
511.2."Not the shape I was going for.... I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions, trying a large, medium and small as my size changed after having twins. Unfortunately, I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on. I don't know why I kept trying aside from desperation. It just gave me a very weird shape. Sure, it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top. I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my ""excess"" down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse. I'm giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it's just my body type that is the problem. I have a long torso at 5'10 and 140lbs. Great product in concept but didn't work at all for me."
512.2."Bones This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up, I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day, they need to make one smooth with out the bones."
513.2."So what is the sizing? I ordered a 3X, because that's the size that the website said to order, it came and lacked about 8 inches closing....so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5x...seemed extreme, but I exchanged it.I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange, I'll say that....However, when the 5X arrived, it's so big it just gaps and falls off? So, was the 3X mislabeled, or is this 5x mislabeled? I'm needing something with some firm support for post surgery care....so I really don't know what to do at this point?"
514.2."Great at first...not so good over time Perhaps I got a bad one? A factory second? For the first 3-4 days I wore mine, it was great, just as advertised, helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist. I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture, too, although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space! However, I put it on today, and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in, the support thing (bone or whatever) under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness. My entire right front is pushing outwards on that, making a vertical bulge; whereas my left side is still firm and compressed. I don't know what could be happening."
515.2."boning is not a plus It holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable, would have been better without it. It also folds in with the fold of my stomach, which I didn't want, so it doesn't get that pooch area as well as I would've liked. I guess if you just want to tuck things in to wear a dress this would be good, thats about it."
516.1."Pass The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed."
517.3."Works great until it develops ripples I bought this waist cincher for two reasons. One for vanity to pull in that belly and the other to help with my back. It does both. I usually squirm when sitting for long periods of time at movies or events. I didn't do that and my back didn't get as tired. It's easier to get into than a corset. It does slim down the tummy. However, it also develops (for lack of a better word) ripples on the side where you would naturally bend. Over time, they became so pronounced that you really can't wear it anymore since you can see it through your clothes. I don't remember exactly how long it took to get that way but maybe 5 or 6 months. I'm still going to buy another one and I'll actually buy two. One to wear around the house during work and the other to wear out. That way they should last longer."
518.2."Poor quality I purchased this item to wear postpartum. I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby. The major downside to this is the poor quality. The eye portion of about five of the hook/eye closures has come out entirely. I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it's only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest. Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others, to instead be a waste of my money!"
519.2."Not the best shaper This would be great if it had boning in it. I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure, but when I put it on, the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist, forming a bulge above and below my waist. Too bad- I had hoped this would work based on reviews."
520.5."Read Look a couple inches over ur belly button. Do you have a 'slouch line'? If no, then this is for u. Nice expensive material feel. Does wat it was made to do. It just didn't work out for me cuz I slouch all the time and it hurts where my belly fat curls. It's for those straight sitting people"
521.3."Really good for the first week, then yikes I bought this 5 months post partum, it made me look really good, I had a waist again, but after using for a week, the wires broke and they were stabbing me, they would really hurt, so I have to remove them. Now this just wont stay in place. It was good while it lasted"
522.4.squeem I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores
523.2."Product defective after 1 day of use The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely. The problem is that after only 1 day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair. I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching. This didn't help the bent supports and I returned the product."
524.3.I WILL PURCHASE THIS ITEM IS GOOD HOWEVER, AFTER WEARING AFTER ABOUT A MONTH YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE IT GETS REALLY OLD AND GETS TO BIG
525.2."No,No,No This is not for me..... I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it!!!!! But this waist cincher is not for me. I'm not gonna say don't buy it because alot of women are shaped different.I just got it yesterday and I'm sending it back. It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all. So if you know you have more than enough back fat, this is not for you. I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help. I wear a size medium, so its my correct size. But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me. The vest covers all the back fat and everything. But I still give Squeem thumbs up though!!! :-)"
526.1."Broke the 2nd time I wore it, great until then I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved."
527.4."I like this, but it hasn't help up well to use. This is exactly what is says - FIRM compression. I got a size small and my waist is a 28-29 inches. It squeezes you in and you will look FABULOUS. You won't be able to eat much, or bend over, but you'll look great! I wore it under a tight dress for a wedding and after about 6 hours, I had to go and take it off so I could wiggle on the dance floor."
528.2."works but uncomfortable Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff...the boning and the hooks showed through, so could not even wear it inside a tshirt. Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it"
529.3."Decent Product The product is good, I will wait for the final results to see if I get back in shape and loose some weight, but as of now, this is good and a decent product."
530.3."Really holds you in!! For compression products, this one is pretty good. I would not recommend anyone wearing it during the summer because it does cause you to sweat. However, it is only slightly uncomfortable is good quality."
531.5.GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION!!! I had two reasons for the purchase of this product, one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful!!! I just cannot express in words how great this product is!!!
532.3."Like it Like the squeem, only issues is that it makes me look ""boxy"", but it does the job. I would like to see a smoother and more natural hold"
533.2."Not so much Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive. Not too happy with their customer service."
534.3."i think i got the wrong size... i got a medium -my jeans size is around 8 so im like i should probably fit into a medium. the hooks are tricky but got em hooked and it fits perfectly...a little too perfectly and veryyyy loose on the underbust...the very very very top of the squeem the beginning line is very loose and it sticks out...but everything else fits perfectly. im very confused..i think im going to get a small and edit this review then. but so far i love it,but itd be way better if it was abit tighter"
535.2.Torture Too tight,wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby, couldn't even close the whole thing!Returned it ASAP
536.2."Squeem The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply."
537.3."Good Product Delivers on what is advertised, but you have to keep on buying new ones because they tear very easily. If it didn't do that, I would have gave it a 5"
538.3."Ok This definitely does what its supposed to, keeps everything nice and firm. The 'warm' sensation gets really hot - almost burning feeling. It's also near impossible to sit, or bend down to pick up anything while wearing it. IF you plan on just standing - it really cinches up the waist and smooths everything makes you look and feel at least a size or two smaller."
539.2."Hard to put on The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes. It is hard to bend over, especially as a school teacher! I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke's Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear!"
540.3."Good shaper This shaper works well. I had a baby a few months ago and this does a good job at holding that last bit of flabby belly skin in. It also creates a nice side silhouette, albeit not AS pronounced as in the internet photographs (those are models after all). It is rubbery on the outside and soft on the inside. I haven't gotten around to wearing it for long periods of time. It shows through thin material so I wouldn't recommend it for use under garments where you would have to worry about that (silk, thin jersey, etc.)."
541.3."squeem I was recommended by my personal trainer that I wear this during workouts to help melt fat. Well it is extremely uncomfortable. After only four days the metal clasps started to pull away from the fabric. not worth the high cost."
542.1."Uncomfortable! It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50.."
543.4."Pretty awesome Definitely a staple for my closet since having my baby! Holds me in, and looks good underneath my clothing. I'm happy with it...and will purchase another one."
544.5."Love it! Help with posture and gives a mommy tummy a nice squeeze. It feels great on my ribs and seems to be bringing them back to pre-baby size. I highly recommend this!"
545.2."Great idea, poor design This shape-wear is the best I've had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on. It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control. However, after about 2 months of daily use, the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric. It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out. I wish there was a better designed support for this binder. Otherwise, it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie. So, if you buy it, expect 2 months of wearing it without problems..."
546.1."Waste of time for me I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me."
547.3."Pokes me because I'm...curvy? I'm curvy.... that's why I ordered it. But those same curves make this thing poke me and I CANNOT wear it all day at work. If i stood all day I probably could. The sizing was a little weird. The difference between an XL and L is a lot. While one is too big the other is too small. It (L) is also loose at the top and too tight at the bottom."
548.3."A good product HOWEVER... One of the pros is that its strapless & worked for me in the Summertime! HOWEVER the con of this product is if you have a little back fat this product does not hide it, intead it created a buldge at the top :( If you want to reshape your waist as well as reduce your back fat...I would go with the vest cause it hides all your back fat!!!! :)"
549.3."Hurts at times I have this product in the vest style which I think I prefer. It has instant results and creates a very slimming figure that commands attention. It digs in right under the breasts and can hurt but just needs to be readjusted. I like how it helps with back pain as well."
550.2."Not worth the pain it causes Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in. However, I found that the rods painfully poked me on the side and ultimately resulted in a wound. Not worth the pain."
551.5."Awesome! I wear this religiously! It's extremely comfortable, I even sleep it in. I wear it as often as I can - only taking it off when I need to. So far so good. The only problem was it smelled like rubber at first since it was so new. I washed it (HAND WASHED, never put things like these in the washing machine/dryer as the item can warp!) and the rubber smell went away. I've only been wearing this for about a week so when it's been a month or so I will post an update. I wear this in conjunction with dieting and light exercise. When I started all of this my waist was 28 1/2 inches. Now it's down to 26 1/2"". I just hope I can actually keep the inches off. My goal is 24"" but even that may be too much."
552.3."Great except for one thing I bought this cincher a month after I had my second baby and it really did help. Anybody who's has just given birth should really wear one of these right after because it really helps shrink your waist. To get the best results, I would wear it all day at home and if I go out I would take it off because, depending on what I'm wearing, one might be able to see thru your clothes . One thing that I really didnt like is that a couple times of wearing it, it started to roll up and I really hated that. But cinchers are great over all but if you can find one that doesn't roll up then, that one is keeper. Thats why I gave it 3 stars because it does help and the material is good, it just rolls up."
553.3."Good for cinching, uncomfortable though It does remove 2-4 inches but it's uncomfortable to wear more than a few times a week. The ""boning"" wrinkles permanently after a couple of wears. I'd wear this under a solid dress on special occasions. I wouldn't wear this under thin fabrics."
554.3."size issue with fat sticking out on top i just recived my squeem which was a szie small i thought will be perfect as my waistline is 30inc but when i tried it on it was sooo tight and i had fat sticking out at top on the sides of my breast lol so im guessing i need a medium size right? so im sending it back and gonna order a bigger size.also when i first put it on one of the hooks was coming out so make ur its not damaged.but overall i look great in it,made me look soo slim but difficult to bend down or breath in it.but im gonna stick with it and see if i loose any weight.btw i weight 130lbs after giving birth to my twins.Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear, Perfect Waist, Firm Compression, Cotton & Rubber, Waist Cincher, Black, medium"
555.2."disappointed I think this is a case of my expectations being too high. I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product, I really was expecting a miracle. After only wearing this twice, it is stretched out. At first, I thought perhaps it would regain it's shape after a few hours but nope! It's no better than a cheap, fashion corset. It will smooth things out so there's less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real ""waist trainer"", something that would go on tight and STAY tight. Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for ""waist trainer"", I would say the claims of this product are misleading. It is shapewear, it is NOT a ""cincher"" or a ""trainer""."
556.1."itchy I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that."
557.5."in love I absolutely love the squeem!!!! Although it does take a couple days to get use to it....... I wear it all day at work and I already see and feel a difference I absolutely live the squeem!!!!"
558.3."Disappointed When I received my order I was so excited to receive it.. But after opening the package I was overwhelmed by the smell of rubber. I didn't know I had ordered tires. The smell was incredible."
559.5."Wow I ordered my Squeem and it came earlier than promised. Mine didn't fit but it was my error and not the company's. I filed for a return and the company replied promptly with instructions to send back and offered to send me a different size. The company is very polite and courteous. It's one of the better companies selling on Amazon. The product itself from what I was able to do with it was very sturdy. The hook and eye enclosures were easy to use and the Squeem molded to my body shape. It was ridged but had give to allow for movement. The outside that goes away from your body is rubber but what actually touches you is a cotton material. It does smell a little like rubber if you put your nose to it but it's not strong enough to smell if you're wearing it. I can't wait to get my new sized one and try it out."
560.4."I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size. I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6, I'm 5'4 and weigh 120lbs right now; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isn't much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress (I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips). I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6"" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last."
561.1."CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!"
562.5."good postpartum compression bought this over the other post-baby belly wraps marketed to pregnant women...and glad i did. the belly wraps are stiff and very visible under clothing, where the squeem is a good ol girdle and forms the mid section into a pretty shape while holding in the jelly belly left over after delivery. you have to wear the waist cincher for 40days/40nights for it to work on getting the belly to shrink; i'm on 2.5 weeks and have already gone from looking 6m prego to less than 3m prego when not wearing it. it also helps with initiating a healthy diet and losing weight b/c it makes you want to look better. but it is not comfortable to wear to sleep; makes me really hot. i have a cheaper wrap from babies r us that is more forgiving, but keeps up with the belly compression."
563.4."Snug Fit Great product for giving you that snug fit...it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long. I really do like this item, the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing...so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt, because everyone will know your secret!"
564.1."Poor quality and lousy customer service The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks."
565.2."Not happy I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not."
566.2."Worked for 5 days then broke I liked how it pulled everything in! I felt fantastic for about 2 hours. it really flattens the tummy area, which is all I really want, but you can see the hooks threw clothes :( I felt like that ruined it for me, also I had to keep pulling it up. It bunches in the back, and really smells like rubber. After about 5 or 6 days one of the ""bones"" on the inside broke and was stabbing me in the side! it really hurt. I would not recommend this product."
567.4."Love it I just had baby and ordered the squeem for post-partum abdominal binding. Its very comfortable and fit perfectly. Its doing a great job getting my stomach down in size. My only issue is that it broke after less than two weeks of wear. I will have to contact the company and get a new one."
568.3."great compression, wrong fit I initially purchased a small for my size 30 waist, and I held my breathe for dear life to put it on, It brought my waist in about 4 inches. By the end of the work day, I could not wait to take this thing off. I recommend wearing a tunic underneath to prevent marks in your skin from the corset. I gave it to my much thinner sister, and she loves it. I purchased the medium next, and it did not make a difference at all, and it was much longer than the small, extending under my boob, to my jeans. I returned it for a different brand, I did love the material."
569.3."Good in theory, problems for work for allergy sufferers. This compression-based waist cincher does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it does it well.However, the product has a strange smell and the latex rubber component is exposed, not covered by fabric so if you have allergy issues, it may cause problems for you.I started sneezing the minute I opened the package. I let it air out but it didn't help. Also, with the rubber exposed, I can imagine that certain fabrics would stick to it and may ride up during wear."
570.4."It works! Not bad, I tried it for 10 days and lost about an inch of my waistline. Need to try it longer to see how it goes."
571.5."squeem is awesome!!! I love my squeem! A little tight at first but I got used to it. I lost 2 inches off my waist in 3 weeks. I love my squeem!!"
572.5."Love, love, love this product! I bought this with the hope I would look slimmer. It did that, and more! I bought a large, and after a week of wear, I am purchasing a medium. I have gotten complements on how much weight I have lost, and I have actually lost weight too. It gives me a shapely figure. I could not be more pleased."
573.3."Great, but not for long torsos I purchased this corset (and make no mistake: it's a CORSET) after the birth of my second son. It took me a while to fit into a medium (I'm a size 8/10) but when I started using it, it certainly does what it says. Unfortunately, I am 6' tall and have a rather long torso, so it looks like I have extra back fat since everything gets squeezed up near the bra area. Ick! Also, the corset cinches together with a hook & eye system, which shows under clingy clothes, so beware. What's great about it is it really sucks it all in...like you're living in the 1700's, which honestly, I didn't mind in small doses. All around, I would LOVE this product if it came in a longer size. But, it doesn't, so only 3 stars from me. : ("
574.4."Great, but not for short ones I purchased it to wear after delivery. Just after delivery I put it on, though I couldn't button every button. But several days ago I was able to button all buttons, a week later to button second line (which squeezes you more). All in all I wore it for a month day and night. It worked perfect, I have no tummy now. The only thing is I'm not on tall side, I'm short, so it was pretty uncomfortable because it was always climbing up and sticking to breasts. Once again if you are on the tall side it will be perfect."
575.4."love the faja! I bought this squeem to help me get my post-pregnancy stomach and waist back. I didn't count on the excellent back support this gives. i am very pleased with this product! The only thing I don't like about it is the rubber smell!"
576.3."My 1st Review! :D Hi, I'm a girl with a very curvy body. A size medium top, bust size 38 D & an XL in my bottoms.My only problem is, I somewhat have a muffin top. Time & time again I've came across this waist cincher, but finally I bought it.I have to say this Squeem compression cincher is only ""alright."" It definately does smooth out all the bump's & bulges, but the clasps are way to obvious! I love the fact that it keeps you tummy rolls discreet even when you sit down. I had no experience with back fat coming out like others did.On me it makes my ""girls"" look smaller. I guess it is because the Squeem somewhat pushes my chest up.So far as comfortability, practicality, and being able to move with this on, I find this really great. I had no trouble walking around & doing my daily routine. The first time I put it on I had a bit of trouble fastening the clasps. It was all good though.How completely NOTICIBLE this product is, is why I only gave it 3 stars."
577.2."Wasn't that impressed........ It didn't do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top, making your breasts and back look MUCH wider. If I do continue to wear it, it will be around the house or under loose clothes/jackets."
578.5."BEST waist cincher I'm extremely impressed with this waist cincher. I had a bridesmaid dress that I had to fit into that was about 2.5 inches too small...I was just about ready to pay over $50 for alterations which would have made the dress different than the other bridesmaids....and then this came in the mail! What a lifesaver! I contacted the tailor quickly and tried on the dress again using the squeem and it fit perfectly. I probably won't use this long term, and I can't imagine using it over diet and exercise for weight loss, but in a pinch, it works great."
579.3."Good product This is a good product. It really does shape you instantly and beautifully. Make sure that you wear something underneath it (i.e. tank) or you will be left with some marks similar to what happened to me. Overall it is a good product...I haven't worn it long enough to see the lasting results."
580.3."Squeem Review So I didn't think I had sensitive skin, but obviously I do because this thing left nasty blisters and whelps all over my midsection and sides.It really does suck everything in and give you a great hourglass figure, but now I have these huge, horrible scars. Maybe I will try to wear it again in the future with an undershirt or something under it, but for now these scars are very discouraging."
581.1.does not fit me! So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed
582.3."i still waiting my lose weight This thing is still to small for me i have to wait before i can use this size. I should offer XXL ;-)"
583.4."great shaper This cincher really works......but it can be uncomfortable when worn on the plain skinfor too long.....I put it on with a tshirt under and it feels much better!"
584.3."I have high hopes! I can't review this it just yet... But I will tell you buy a size larger than you think you are! According to the chart pre-pregnancy I'm a medium. I'm 5'6 and had a 27 inch waist. I'm 3 months pregnant with twins and bought to ensure I'd have immediately after my delivery. It didn't even fit correctly around me at 3 months pregnant. Runs small.I can't wait to see if the squeem really works! Keep you posted."
585.1."Too small Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon."
586.3."sizing info was not clear! I ordered a medium (because that is my size in everything) and it does not fit. I tried looking for measurements on page prior to ordering and did not see any sizing chart, etc... I am very disappointed for the fact that producct looks good and is made very well I would of loved to try it out."
587.1."Awesome! It's pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty. I'd rather pay $$$ and buy something that works the way it should."
588.4."Does the job I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect."
589.4."A skeptical look at the search for alien intelligence Rood and Trefil wrote this book because the media were being influenced primarily by scientists who were very optimistic about finding extraterrestrial life. The two authors describe ""the conventional wisdom"" as defined by Carl Sagan, Frank Drake and others. Then Rood and Trefil examine the key factors one by one, ending each chapter with a section called ""Consequences for SETI"" or ""Implications for SETI."" Basically, they come up with much lower numbers than the optimists; the Earth is special after all. Rood and Trefil do quick surveys of space colonization and the prospects for interstellar travel, dismissing the idea that UFOs carry alien visitors. Each author wrote a separate conclusion to the book, giving his personal views. Though now slightly dated, Are We Alone makes points that still must be addressed by SETI advocates."
590.5."Awesome! This CD is amazing. I am very sad that 107.7 The X in Birmingham is no longer. They made a great CD to benefit a great cause."
591.2."Doesn't Work! I received this action figure as a gift and was extremely excited to use it. I was so disappointed when I found that the head will NOT pop off. Sadly, I have to hold Her Royal Highness upside down and shake off her head while pressing the button. This was very disheartening and I would only recommend it to people who aren't planning to try to eject the head."
592.5."Clever design Marie Antoinette is my daughter's favorite female historical figure. She was very smart, but not when it came to spending. She was a child bride from Austria who, as custom dictated, had to leave all her possessions at the border- including her beloved little doggie."
593.3."weird, which I like fun, not as big as I had envisioned. The grandkids liked it. Just strange enough to work for me. Not too morbid"
594.2."Dont order them in white or any light color We have owed these plates in white for quite some years. maybe six or more. I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable. My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain. I will never buy these again."
595.4."Music from the Game to real life in your living room Well the album was awesome. I loved how it would go in sequence to the game. But there were two songs that were missing in the album but that's cool. Over all if your a band geek like me you'll love this soundtrack. Dennis Martin did a great job over all."
596.2."I just wanted Jimmy Ponder (too little guitar on this one) I couldn't wait to get this CD,being a guitarist myself. Just give me straight Jimmy Ponder, not horns and other ""jazz types"". I am disappointed. Cuts two and four are the best. They are Jimmy. Too bad I couldn't have listened to cuts first, I would not have bought this CD. Sorry! The cuts of just Jimmy are great though, but too few .... :("
597.1."Negative Stars! Avoid like flesh eating bacteria! ""Lets jiggel the camera to show that the ground is shakeing!""Special effects; haloween leftovers.Acting; Well, the cast managed to repeat memorized lines.Casting apears to have been done in a trailer park.Script; I know nine year olds who write better stories.Cinimatography; Someones home cam.Conclusion: Anoyingly boreing and essentially unwatchable waist of time and money."
598.2."conspiracy theorist The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind. You may read it to understand how the bigot's mind actually works."
599.4."Barry D. Gilfry, Editor I was the final editor of this book. I spent a week secreted at Lake Tahoe making the corrections. I thought the cover was rather garish, but this is a book with a lot of heart. George Ellis spent a lot of time helping people who, otherwise, would have had little hope.This book is an inspiration and should be put back into print."
600.4."Very, Very Good, But.... ....I have a CD version of the original release on CBS Associated and it kicked in three previously unreleased tracks. These were two original tracks by Eumir Deodato ""Latin Flute"" and ""Venus"" and Deodato's fabuloso rendition of Steely Dan's ""Do It Again""... but heck, at least ""Deodato II"" it has been rereleased somewhere in all it's Creed Taylor/Rudy Van Gelder splendor. Deodato's jazzy versions of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and ""Nights in White Satin"" were noted to be two of the best fusion performances ever done when this one came out. Listen for licks by Billy Cobham, Stanley Clarke, Tropea on guitar, and Hubert Laws on flute..."
601.3."Works Great This stand works great for my euphonium, only issue is that the bottom pad adhesive doesn't work well and I have to continually find and retack the pad in place prior to using."
602.3."The spinning sound is getting louder I have the 8 MB cache version of this hard drive. The speed of this hard drive is ok. Ease of installation is average. It runs quietly until recently the spinning sound is getting louder. Also once in a while it makes some kind of clicking noise followed by a beep. I used to own Seagate, Quantum, and Maxtor hard drives and none of them have this kind of noise.So far there is no data loss or any kind of damage. But this is very annoying because I am afraid that something is going to happen."
603.4."Nothing but action See story summary above.No doubt an action packed story that'll take you from spots in England to spots in the Mideast. Pure action all the way. If that's all your looking for, look no further. As far as details and dialogue are concerned, there is very little to sink your teeth into, which is typical for a Higgins novel. Though short and to the point, I do enjoy his books. I would match super hero Sean Dillon against any fictitious villian. Good escapist fiction and quick reading make this book enjoyable.Recommended."
604.1."WARNING: This is the worst book ever written As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review."
605.2."Disappointing and too simplistic This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. The action is thin as well, characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail. Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax."
606.4."HIGGINS IS ON A HIGH WITH THIS ONE Taut and tense, an explosion of sequential thrill packed events - these are hallmarks of the popular novels springing from the pen of the seemingly inexhaustible Jack Higgins. ""Edge Of Danger,"" his 32nd suspense laden powerhouse is no exception.The Belfast born author now brings us a harrowing tale with former IRA member, Sean Dillon, confronted by the Rashid's, an English/Arab family sworn to avenge the killing of one of their own by a Russian diplomat who was driving drunk. When the diplomat is provided immunity by Russia and America, vengeance is sought with the life of the American president.Action swerves throughout the world until a terrifying finale takes place in a remote castle."
607.4."A fast fun read Sean Dillon again impishly dances the Irish Jig through England, Ireland, and parts of Saudi Arabia, while efficiently wounding and killing every bad guy in or out of sight and drinking a Bushmill's while doing it all. Saying that, Higgins can put out a story that keeps the pages turning, your mind working and suddenly reaching the end you are thinking of his next offering. Heres hoping the next is as good. God bless all here."
608.1."Worst of theYear...or, maybe the decade Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it."
609.2."Sophomoric at Best Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. ""Damn, he said to Kate, ""It's the Hazar Scouts, "" Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good"
610.1."A Waste of Time This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it."
611.4."Plenty of action This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth."
612.1."Good story- Poor writing Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books."
613.1."Disappointment on every page I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."
614.2."Tired formula Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons, fine dining, glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development. Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers. And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another -- sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes -- strains credulity.Higgins has done some first-rate work. Had this been published twenty-five years ago, this might have made a difference. It wasn't and it doesn't."
615.1."This is not the Jack Higgins I know This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book."
616.1."Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?"
617.1."Can't believe I read the whole thing Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did."
618.1."I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have... Very few books contain their own review. This one does:""Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'""'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'""This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle."
619.1."A bad book, poorly written. The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts."
620.1."Poorly Written The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again."
621.3."Another Sean Dillon story This is a fast moving story, with lots of action and superficial details. It is not great literature, but provides some light brain candy. Lots of bodies are left lying around as people are killed by various means (shooting, drowning, incineration, torture, falling off a roof).An Arab fanatic, annoyed by U.S. and Russian oil interests exploiting his country, decides on a high profile assassination. Nothing seems to work out for the bad guys, but some of the British ended up wounded.The story has an interesting ending with a very rich woman with a grudge, biding her time, and planning to spend portions of her wealth to get revenge. It brings to mind Matilda of Flanders (wife of King William I) who, spurned by a Saxon nobleman when she was a teenager, waited 20 years until William conquered England, then tracked down the Saxon and had him thrown into a dungeon."
622.4."Only 2 stars? I've read a number of the reviews, and thought they were too hard. This is escapism - nothing more, and nothing less. The dialogue is trite and cliche, and the plot formulaic. But that is what makes Higgins so good. Its fun! And sure you have to suspend disbelief occassionally to make the plot work - but what's the harm with that? I enjoyed this book. It returns Higgins back to form after a number of less successful books in recent years. Even inspite of the cliches and plot formulas, there is a distinct 'grittiness' about the characters, which has been long over due."
623.1."Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to ""speak Irish"" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."
624.2."Disappointing and thin I purchased this book expecting very good things. I found the plot very thin and predictable. There was very little suspense. It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out. Also there didn't seem to be any character building or background to explain why these individuals would have such singleminded, and on the surface stupid, behaviour."
625.1."Two Hacks I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA"
626.2."Just skip it When you read a book you know that what are you reading is not 100% true, but when you start to read things that are completely wrong is another thing. For an example I have these questions:Q. How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody, the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance?A. I don't know if the mob knows it but at least four times.Q. Why the target man, who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him?A. Because the target man likes to be in danger.Q. When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn't he?A. Because something in his head didn't let him even if he had killed many men before.And as the energizer rabbit, I can keep going and going and going, my advise is to skip this book."
627.3."Time warp - we're back in 1981 Everything about this album has 1981 written all over it. Synth pop at its extreme, yet that's what was 'in' back then. Listening to it now takes some strength, but it's a classic all the same. 'Misplaced Love' is the best on this album, and is hard to find on CD - so worth getting for that song alone."
628.3."Stay with the studio recordings I like Robbie's material but the real test of a live album is this: Do I play it on a regular basis? For example, I listen to the Band's ""Rock of Ages"" alot but not this CD. Good but not great best describes this CD."
629.1."Worst ""Live"" recording I've ever bought! I bought this CD for one song only, ""Steal Away"". I knew it was going to be ""live"", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a ""muzik, lounge"" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was ""Hot Rod Hearts"", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most ""live"" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of ""Steal Away""!"
630.5."Wonderful! This book was just what I was looking for! HIGHLY informative information on each herb along with lore and magickal uses. It also explains deity correspondences and points out what sabbat you might use each herb for. I recommend this to anyone interested in magickal or medicinal uses of herbs.The product came early and the book was in excellent condition!"
631.3."Good but I'm hesitant to use the remedies This is without mistake, among the better herbal magic books. However, I originally bought it thinking it was on herbal alchemy rather than use for spells. It has a few too many psychological cures and not very many practical ones. You have to infer about how magical cures might turn out as medical ones. And since I mentioned alchemy, most of these are turned into incense, rather than into potions or elixirs.Otherwise, it is a very good book, especially if you're a witch in need of how to use herbs for ceremony. Ceremony is this book's specialty. It does tell many herbs used for funerals, protection, or sexual prowess."
632.4."Good book! As some reviewers already stated, P. Beyerl's magical corespondences (some of them) seem arbitrary. On the other hand most of them are in accord with the tradition and seems ok. But if you put these 'errors' aside, 'Compendium of Herbal Magick' is still a very good (and very nicely illustrated) book with plenty of true informations and interesting stories regarding a lot of herbs. So I think that despise some errors (here and there) in the correspondences, (more than 80% of the attributions seems ok), it is nevertheless a very pleasant and respectable lecture. Buy it for its informations, for its interesting stories and for its nice illustrations but sometimes look elsewhere for the herb's correspondences. I give it four stars."
633.4."Super, thorough diagnostics tool Yes, you need the software to stream data to your computer, but it's well worth it. Buy others ($$$$$$) and see what you think. This real-time machine is superb. Data input all depends on your car's computer and what data it supplies. Seems like the most data is provided by the Corvette's computer. Hondas, for instance, provide minimal information."

SOME HIGHLIGHTS IN CLUDE THE REMAKE OF ""TOM'S DINER"" AND THE NEW CLASSIC ""THE SUMMER"" BY ATB. IF YOU LIKE DANCE MUSIC YOU SHOULD INVEST IN THIS COLLECTION."
635.2."not very well written This book was well reviewed and I was very disappointed. Even if it's written for poor readers, does it have to read like Dick and Jane? Children are young, not simple-minded. Give kids real literature or they won't keep reading, they'll plug in to the media."
636.5."A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other ""Woman against the odds"" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's ""Shelters of Stone""."
637.1."A thorn in the side of literature. Hawthorne's use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable, yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points. He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax. The climax(es) happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book. Read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment."
638.4."Excellent Book I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone."
639.4."A book about revenge, remorse and love. When Hester Prynne commited adultury with Aurthor Dimmesdale she was condemned to where the Scarlet Letter A on her bosom as a reminder to herself and o other around her about her harsh deed, mean while Roger Chillinworth, her husband, vowed that he would find out with whom Hester commited the sin. This was a great book because it is full of suspense and continuous sinning. The only problem with it is that it is fairly hard to read so much time and patience must be put into it."
640.1."technical problems with cassettes This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product."
641.2."Absolute Waste of Time My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I can't say if I'll ever forgive her. Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism. WAY OVERRATED."
642.2."A Tedious Read I hate Hawthorne's style of writing. It's over-bloated and self-indulgent. I wish he'd just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on. The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera. All of the characters are one-dimensional. I'm not going to say the book is poorly written, but it's written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read. Overall, a disappointment."
643.3."NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER BOOKS This book is not as good as some other books, but it is much better than some books. That is why I gave it three stars and not no stars or five stars. Democracy prevails. Buy me a drink. Now, take off your clothers. Yes, just like that. I think we are beginning to understand each other..."
644.1."Classic? Really? I will never understand how ""Classics"" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is."
645.3."Oh I CAN wait I am fixing to have to read this book for English 3, in high school, of course. I am really dreading it. I could honestly care less about adultery in New England way back then, and the length of the book is definitely going to make that a lot worse. I am positive I am going to have to analyze every paragraph in this dam book, I'm fixing to live up my summer!"
646.2."This book was OK............ The Scarlet Letter, for me was just a little boring. Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it. Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other. I would only reccomend this book to other people who liked reading lots of description, a little dialouge, and a repetitive storyline."
647.2."I've read better. I'm a 13 year old kid and I just finished reading this book for an English class I am taking. Although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel. I did not like it very much. I think it maybe that I'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature."
648.2."The Scarlett Letter Overall ok. Not much going on here. A lot of internal dialogue, nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie to the book."
649.3."classic It had been a very long time since I read this book. It was well worth a re-read. We all know the meaning of the scarlett letter. We know that Hester commited adultry since her husband was away and she became pregnant. But do we remember the father of the baby? I didn't! Do we remember why she didn't tell who he was? I didn't.It is not only a good read but an important statement about where this country has come from! Knowing what happened when the religious were in charge of laws and punishment should give all of us a wake up call. Had I been alive in those days I would have probably been burned at the stake. Scary!"
650.2."This edition is not complete This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, ""The Custom-House."" Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition."
651.3."review I was not really my type of read. I couldn't get into the root of the story, but some people probably would like it"
652.3."The Scarlet Letter this book was really hard to understand. Then again, I've never really been a big fan of the classics. But I got bored way too easily, and I honestly thought the last thirty or forty pages were the best part."
653.5."Great Transaction! I placed an order for a book, the seller accepted payment quickly, the item shipped very fast, in fact I had item in hand in less than a week and it was exactly as described. Thank you for a pleasant transaction."
654.5."An American Classic I first read The Scarlet Letter (TSL) back in high school. I thoroughly enjoyed the book then. Going back and rereading a second time still brought back the awe associated with the imagery painted by Hawthrowne. Perhaps the most striking image is that in the beginning, where Hester Prynne is about to come out of her jail cell and a single rose blossoming amidst the bleakness of her prison is used as a metaphor. Hawthrowne does a superb job describing the details and ways of life. I believe he captures 17th century Bostonian life accurately. In a way this book is a history book. I do admit that the plot is slow at times, but the book does appear to move much more quickly if you try to admire Hawthrownes writing style and descriptive language. Overall, I would say this book impressed me as much as War and Peace and some of Dickens' novels did."
655.3."Worth a read This book was not easy to get into with the old-style text but it was an interesting view into an era that is so very different from today. Set in 1850 the novel appeas to give a realistic picture of the times and was worth the read."
656.5."i love books The description was exactly as written. Fast shipping and great costumer service. I would recommend the product and the seller."
657.5."Sad Story I love it but it saddened me. . . I will read it again . . . but will wait a while. Life can appear to be unfair sometimes. . ."
658.3."I'd like to thank my English Teacher Although the book is highly boring and very difficult to read I really appreciate the fact that my high school English teacher made us read this back in the day. Thanks to her I have impressed my friends when we play Jeopardy or any other quiz shows."
659.2."Typos The most irritating part about reading this book is the typos. The book is already difficult to read with Hawthorne's prolix writing. I had to check with a different edition of The Scarlet Letter just to confirm whether or not it was a typo. Also, it would have been nice to have some footnotes like other editions do."
660.4."Decent book, but definately not Hanry David Theraou It was a good book to read given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraou's book Walden."
661.2."Boring I tred to enjoy this novel. In fact I battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel. The history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but I applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey."
662.3."A cautionary tale. The Scarlet Letter is a catuionary tale set in a time with a very different moral code. This makes for fascinating reading at the start however, the writing style is so long-winded and introspective that it is not a particularly satisfying read. I wanted to fast forward through a lot of it to get to the action. The unusual characters in the story are well described and I liked the writers attempt to portray a ""fallen woman"" in a sympathetic light - and with unusual strength. I appreciated it for the insights, but won't be recommending it."
663.4.Great read Awesome plot I particularly liked the theme to be portray in such a way that you may be pushed over the top over false hood also the kindle edition was a fictional read
664.2."Review From One Book At A Time I hate giving classics bad reviews. This book was not for me. Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it. If it had been any longer I would have stopped. It did catch my interest a little in the end, but not enough to redeem the book in any way."
665.4."Amazingly Good I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected."
666.2."Not my idea of a good read I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages. I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't been forced to by the school. And the introductory thing is torture."
667.2."Good book to read if you were bored to death! I read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May. I usually read ALL the time. If it's a good book, I can read it in less than 1 day. Sometimes it even takes me 1-2 hours. But this book took me 3 weeks. I couldn't believe how long it took me! Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school. (UGH!) Please don't read this book, only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand."
668.4."A well written book!! The Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading. It was not boring. It had sense to it. It has alot of symbols in it that makes sense and has a purpose instead of just being there."
669.1."Duller than dirt I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."
670.4."A frustrating story, only for literary fanatics. This book has a nice plot, but it just isn't exciting. It's not riveting enough, maybe because it was written in the 19th century. Things that are exciting more than a 100 years ago just don't seem all that interesting to me. It's hard to read because most of the book is composed of metaphors and other examples of figurative language. If you had to read it, I'd say give yourself at least three weeks."
671.4."Scarlet Letter review I think that The ""Scarlet Lettter"" is a very well written book. One of the things that I would watch out for, is the vocabulary and how it is used in the context. The vocabulary is very confusing at times. However, it can lead you on to another world by wisking you off in the times where the""Scarlet Letter"" took place. Other than that, I think this book is very good. I personally liked the characters and their roles in the story. The main character,""Hester Prynne"", is written very carefully and it shows how she struggles to go on with her life. That is the only thing I can say about this book. You have to read the rest to find out what happens....."
672.4."A REALLY GOOD BOOK This book was very good i had to read it for school I didn't really understand it the first time but each time i read it, it gets better."
673.5."Excellent It is Hawthorne, of course it is excellent. Well written and worth a slow, methodical approach. Definitely a literary classic."
674.2."Wasted Time There is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel. Throughout the novel, only 3 major events occur: one in the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to. Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one. In the end, if you are looking to read great American novels, skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain."
675.5."Classic Book that I can read on my iPad Great book and it is nice to be able to read it on my iPad. Also, loved the price (FREE!) :)"
676.3."The scarlet letter The book had a lot of fluff in it. It was hard to understand mostly because it had a lot of symbolism."
677.2."DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!! Please, I beg of you, if you have any respect for your own time whatsoever, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! Maybe if a couple of generations completey ignore it, it will cease to be a so-called classic. First of all, it is written in pretty difficult language. That is all fine and good if the book is worth the effort, but this one definitely is not. The author has no knowledge of subtlety and his message is both wrong, I believe, and poorly conveyed. The second star is given only because his use of language is sometimes impressive, but I would sooner read a taudry romance novel than re-read The Scarlet Letter."
678.3."Quite good I can't agree with people complaining that Hawthorne uses a difficult language. I am not english-speaking and yet I found it pretty easy to understand and follow. (By the way: at what age does the average American boy master his mother tongue and when is he able to read anything that comes within his reach without the support of a dictionary? it seemes impossible to me that a 16-year-old can't read a book written in the 19th century!! Come on, Hawthorne is no Chaucer!) On the whole, The Scarlet Letter is not my favourite book, but it is well written and well structured. Let us give it its due."
679.2."A book for those with time on their hands If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience. Don't read it unless you don't mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences, antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point."
680.3."Good Writing, Bad History This book was written in the 19th century to make a point about the 19th century. To do so, however, it caricatures the 17th-century Puritans pretty badly, a people who were generally cheerful, generous, and deeply suspicious of legalism. They even wore colorful clothing.I encourage you to read The Scarlet Letter as a classic novel that speaks to a number of universal human themes, just don't expect it to be historically accurate."
681.1."Who Chooses Classics? I don't see how this book gets so much attention as being ""one of the best novels ever."" It's very short, and very boring. It's written in old english, which adds to the difficulty, and even if you can understand it, you finish the book and say, ""Ok, so what's the point?"" There is absolutely no point to this novel. Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text, and the description is so vague that you can't even tell what a character is doing half the time."
682.1."""Hallelujah!"" is what I said when I finished this book This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a ""CLASSIC""?"
683.3."Great story...difficult to understand. I purchased this book because I was told that in junior year it's required to read this novel. Instead my teacher showed us a movie version that follows the book exactally, but I decided to read the book for fun. If it wouldn't have been for the help of my English teacher I never would have understood this novel, but from what I did gather it had a great story and wonderful moral. If you are good at reading Hawthorne's style of writing, I suggest you read it because it is good, just hard to follow at times."
684.3."the letter I thought that the book was good as far as the issues in the book, but as far as me reading it for my own pleasure, I can't say that I would. I did enjoy the discussions that could arise from this book."
685.5."The Best Of Puritans This is a very interesting book. I started reading it in my 4th period English class. I think it is a good book because somehow it relates to what people do, when they feel superior to other people. I think you should read this book, because it is very interesting. Plus, it was written by the great Nathaniel Hawhthorne!"
686.3."Girls just want to have fun The story may have had some merit however the writing style was so archaic and verbose that it took 50 words to complete a sentence. After trudging through about 100 pages he never came to any points or conclusions other that some people can remember what they ate 20 years ago in detail. This guy (Nathaniel Hawthorne) could have competed with Marry Shelly for most long-winded of the year. Some of it may not be his fault due to the writing style of the time but we surly do not have to put up with this.This is one time that just about any movie exceeds the book. If you insist on reading then it may be smart to find a child's version. Son one could get rich translating the book into today's English."
687.2."Boring, very This book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes don't relate to us very much any more. The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end. I really disliked the book."
688.2."Boring My english teacher assigned this book, one I would never read on my own. I am a 16 year old and I enjoy reading. But this book, while it does have a few good points and messages, is incredibly dull. The points are hard to get and I only understood the points after we had discussed them in class. While this book has a rather good story it`s concealed by endless symbols and references, I suggest the cliff notes version!!"
689.3."Although it was hard to understand, I enjoyed the book. I thought that The Scarlet Letter was a very challenging book. In my opinion, it has been the hardest book that we have read this year. I am a big time daydreamer when I read, which is why I think it took me a long time to understand. If you can stay focused, go for it! It can be a really touching and interesting book, but if you daydream like me, get a few of your friends to read it, too. It may help you to understand it better. If my class did not have daily discussions on it, I would not have liked the book as much as I did!"
690.2."Really Hard to Follow This is another classic out in the book world but I find it extremely hard to follow. Hawthorne had a lot of good points in the book but I didn't understand them until they were pointed out to me. If you don't get into that Puritan time period of literature then I suggest you don't read it. There is a lot of symbolism in this book, too."
691.3."It was a good novel... The story was great, but I read it in 11th grade and was unable to understand it very well.....it is very wordy and complicated but overall, it is a great book. It is a very profound tale of sin and public ignominy, it is definitely a classic for adults, but definitely not for teens... This but is not a masterpiece"
692.3."Depends on what you like... I had to read this book for English class, and I did not enjoy it. My favorite genre is scifi-technthriller, and this clearly is not it. However, although I had to force myself to flip to the next page, when we analyzed it in class the book was amazing. Hawthorne can be considered nothing less than a pure genius in his writing. We could easily spend 30 minutes talking about a single page in our class of 17. The amount of detail and hidden information is astonishing. So, if you like love stories, (which I think this can be considered), this is the book for you. Otherwise, buy a Tom Clany novel."
693.2."I was fored to read it too The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book. I wouldn't tell anybody to read it unless they classic books or a Hawthorne fan. This book and also The House of The Seven Gables are based on the one unlying rule of Hawthorne description. His books wouldn't be so long if he would have just gotton to the plot. Now don't get me wrong the plot to this book was good but the movie is even better. If you have to read it just deal with it. All I know is that is didn't hold my attenion very long and I fell asleep a couple of times."
694.5."I don't remember buying this. I did read the book in hs, so maybe that is when I bought it, but who knows. I just have to write words so that I can be done with reviewing this."
695.2."too had to read I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to read...haven't got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here"
696.2."No Active Table of Contents My rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book. I really feel like I don't have any right to complain since the book was free but -you get what you pay for.The book starts with an introduction to the story which goes on for 18% of the book file. The actual text of the book doesn't start until location 604-10. Unfortunately the only way to find this is to page through from the beginning. It would have been nice to have a table of contents or at least a bookmaark for the start of the actual book."
697.4."If you get past the first thirty pages, you'll be all right... This slim book is like a three-course meal, where the appetizer is yak anus tartare, the entree is three-day-old caviar, and dessert is a Three Musketeers bar. That is to say, the first part, the Customs House prelude, is so floridly antiquated and negligible, that all but the sternest high-schoolers who've never had a bar or bat mitzvah will give up and read the Wikipedia plot summary for Monday's quiz. However, once past that interminable overture, the story actually picks up a bit, though it never really takes flight, and the ending is...pat. Hawthorne's idea of the scarlet letter is much more ingenious than his execution: the seed never sprouts as high as it should."
698.3."Ugh Forcing students to read novels such as this could be considered one of the primary obstacles to promoting reading as an independently pursued hobby. The story, I'll admit, was a good idea. However, the moody overromanticized method of telling it stifled what was a good idea. Hawthorne was a victim of the style of the times--not a victim of bad writing. In short, a great book to have read, but a miserable book to read."
699.1."Landscape book I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me."
700.4."Scarlet Letter I found that this book was full of text that is not exactly for the typical high school reader. It is mostly out of date, so most people don't understand unless they are fairly good readers.As for the story. I believe that is was beautifully put together. I think that it is great how Hester (the main character) uses her sin as a way to show that she has strong character. The way it is portrayed is remarkable. I believe that if you are an american literature fan, this is a must-read. The reason for the 4-stars instead of five, most of the vocabulary takes more than basic skill to comprehend."
701.4."THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF SIN, TABOO THIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO. THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITE-WASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD, THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY. HOWEVER, THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO."
702.3."It was ok. This book is very interesting! Unfortunately it's hard to understand. The version I read was Barnes and Noble Classics 2003, with notes by Nancy Stade. It's about how people deal with sin. What would you do if you were involved with adultery? Hester Prynne had to wear a scarlet A on her clothes as a mark of shame to ""purify"" her. Arthur Dimmesdale hid his secret for seven years, which tormented him with guilt. Roger Chillingsworth lived a bitter and revengeful life after the incident. I would recommend this book for people who can understand old English. It is a story with a good moral. It talks about confessing sin, the consequences of sin, and forgiving others. - Daniel W."
703.2."Missing Custom House My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. We ""looked inside this book"" on line and it shows that it includes the custom house. When the book arrived, it did not include the custom house. Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class."
704.5."The Scarlet Letter It is a very well written book. A little slow to get into, but once there it moved very well and was a pleasure to read."
705.4."Good quality, not as good in comparison to others. I bought this for my junior year in high school (11th grade), with the intention to take notes & highlight in the book. Our class was simply asked to buy one copy of The Scarlet Letter, and version would do. A book is a book, and I have two very minor complaints about mine.1) This (as with many Dover Thrift Edition books, apparently) is a ""Green Edition"" book. What this means for me is that the pages are ultra thin, and whenever I use pen or highlighter ink it seeps through the pages, making the back much less legible.2) This book lacks footnotes. Not a requirement, but considering that most available versions of this book have helpful footnotes, those would have been nice.Not large faults of the books, just simple ones that caught my eye."
706.5."No wonder it‘s a classic. A great read that could easily be translated into modern situations. The way Hawthorne explains thing and his use of sybolism adds so much more to the story."
707.2."Characterization in The Scarlet Letter The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story. However, the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman, Hester, has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin. This story is a historical fiction told 200 years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society. The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story."
708.4."Book Review I am sure this is a book we were required to read in high school because I know the story well, but did not remember all the details. There was much more use of narrative than dialog and I had a hard time with that at first, but I can say I did enjoy the book."
709.5."Detailed, Beautiful, Tragic, & Engaging Hawthhone's ""The Scarlet Letter"" is literature at it's finest. The attention to detail for both settings, and especially the thoughs of the characters will chain you to this book. Sin, regret, guilt, self-punishment, and revenge are all detailed in relation to an extramarital affair resulting in a pregnancy. The symbolism is beautiful, the plot tragic, the characters engaging. The ""Scarlet Letter"" is a true masterpiece."
710.2."I just don't get it. I am an avid reader. I have read many so called ""classics"". This book is just plain boring! Yawn.... I really tried to get into it. I couldn't finish it. I just kept falling asleep. This book contains some seriously long sentences. Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so. I couldn't do that. It just seems wrong. If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all. I am sorry to say ""I have not read the Scarlet Letter."" Sorry Hawthorne.... I really, really tried."
711.3."Wordy Nathaniel It was fun reading after not reading for 50 years, but Hawthorne certainly could have told the story without so much embellishment! It was interesting to compare the social mores of that time and the tremendous changes that have occurred since then."
712.4."I read it as a young girl qnd loved it, but reread was different. I loved this book when I was about twelve. It was so tragic and really held me. However, on my reread I found I didn't like the characters as much. I guess I lost a believe that social pressure could make people hide and internalize something as common as a child born out of wedlock. So this book is still a good read, but I think in my more mature adult self I just didn't care for the plot as much."
713.3."Interesting. I had to read this for 10th grade English and it was very interesting. Very boring but interesting and a decent work of literature."
714.3."nice book i'm glad they have these books online for free. i can read these anytime and it's very nice that i can read these on my kindle fire hd."
715.5."great thing I had to read this for school and since it was on my kindle I could just search a word to find the quote I needed. great book! Hawthorn's syntax is just so lengthy!!"
716.5."Best Tale of Scandal and Deceptjon I was required to read this book for English class, and it's my favorite book we've read all year :) full of juicy drama, scandal, and humor, the book is more like an entertaining Spanish soap than a boring classic novel some find it to be. If you look at the boon with the right eyes, you can enjoy it :))"
717.3."A difficult read. On first glance, such a slim volume would seem to be something you could read quickly. Not so! The turgid and heavy prose is over-ornamented and complicated by ye olde New England Puritan syntax.I suspect that even when it was written Hawthornes prose was never accessible, and in the modern context it is so far from spoken english that reading it is like wading through treacle. It is sweet, cloying and ultimately sickening.The underlying story is simple, a universal enough theme to span the ages, and could easily be rewritten well into the modern context.It is never easy to be harsh with a book that is listed as a ""classic"" but in this case I feel I must be truthful about it. This is not an easy nor an enjoyable read. It is hard work. To be oxymoronic I suppose it is the heaviest light read and the fattest slim book I have encountered.Read it at your peril!"
718.1."Ugh. I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word ""ugh"" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through ""dost thou"" after ""dost thou"" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book ""The Classics Reclassified""."
719.1."Avg. Rating too high I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace."
720.1."Received a different book I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received."
721.1."Oh my... This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, ""Baby daddies,"" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster."
722.2."Far too little crime and fist fights So I heard about this from a friend at Comi-Con. He did not know much about it, but heard some people talking about it in the food court. I thought it sounded awesome, like Read or Die meets a cross between The Green Lantern and The Crimson Crusader. So I order what I thought was the graphic novel, turns out it is more ""novel"" and less ""graphic"". It was nothing like I expected, and unless shame is a super power (which is unlikely) Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existed!Seriously, I don't think ""BANG!"" ""POW!"" or ""ZORT!"" show up anywhere in the book! I almost gave this one star, but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name. His physiognomy is dead on as well, like in all comics, it let's us know he is the clear bad guy and we should not relate to him at all. Since the bad guy at least fits what I expect this gets 2 stars."
723.2."Get to the point already Too long. Re-read this and remembered how much Hawthorne's style irritates me. There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it."
724.2."Slow moving predictable story The story is a very simple one but the action, so to speak, doesn't really happen until the final third of the book. It was a battle to get through the dry middle!Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least.On the plus side, the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres."
725.3."One of my least favorite english reads. Like most people I was forced to read this novel in my English class. While I did enjoy it eventually it does have a very slow beginning. It has a good plot though and is a great way to understand the period in which Hawthorne wrote.In my opinion this novel has one major flaw; metaphors. Yes most novels employ literary elements yet Hawthorne goes over board. He will give you a metaphor, give you another metaphor the same thing in case you didn't understand the first one; he will then flat out explain what the metaphor was. After a few chapters of this it gets very tedious and continues on through the book. The metaphors are not difficult to understand, yet he will often give long drawn out metaphors that may take over a page."
726.3."hated the daughter the daughter was a brat. as abusive as the puritans were they really dropped the ball when it came to her. seriously, what ever happen to "" better to beat the child then let them be damned by the devil""?. the story itself has some interesting ideas. such as if the ""A"" came from the inside out or the outside in. ultimately, because of the way you choose to answer that question, and who you apply that answer to , does make it a classic. over all, even with its interesting ideas, i didn't find it a very good read."
727.3."The Scarlet Letter Review by Tazmania I think that the book was ok. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that there wasn't enough talking amoung the characters in the book. Even though I couldn't understand some of the words in the book, I recommend this book to people who like a good, challenging book."
728.4."Definitely A Must Read I thought this book was an excellent piece of writing. The symbolism surrounding such objects as the ""A"" itself, the blacken weeds, and the sign in the sky make the story deep, and leave much of it open for interpretation. Hawthorne's use of details was also very good. His descriptions added so much to the plot and setting, but mostly to the symbolism of the book. I think the book is definitely a ""must read."""
729.3."Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlett Letter This book was very boring. Only at the end was I somewhat interested in who the father was and what Roger Chillingworth would do. The language was a tad difficult to understand, but after watching the movie (not the one with Demi Moore), it helped a lot. It is full of metaphors."
730.1."I read to pages of this novel and I had to stop! I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!"
731.1."I don't get it. I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school (22 years ago). I couldn't get through it; the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test. I found it turgid and laborious reading.I graduated in the top 10% of my high school class. I have a master's degree. Despite my academic success, I don't understand why this book is a classic. I don't understand why Hester didn't just pack up Pearl and her stuff, move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow. That would have saved everyone alot of grief, especially young readers like me."
732.1."I hate this book. This is the worst book I have ever read. The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust."
733.3."Scarlet Letter, more like Scarlet Whateva! This book is off the hook, the bad hook that is. I comprehend that it is a grand piece of historical literature but if it was a tad more interesting than it might just grab my attention. More adultery might work too. In conclusion, if you are forced to read this book like i was, its ok. yo peace off the hizzle fo shizzle my nizzle"
734.1."get it away I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read! But this book, it does have it's interesting points but I just don't get into it. I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class. What did I have to do to deserve this? I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other, I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasn't getting to me. And the way the author addresses the reader, I want to scream. I'm sure in the 1850's this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then, but more than 100 years afterwards, people seem to lose interest. And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide. STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK! DON'T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE!"
735.2."Overrated Pretentious Trash This novel is widely regarded as overrated. The plot is not that interesting, the writing style is torturous,the plot twists are predictable. It's a typical example of pre-20th century bad writing. Not to say that any book from that era is crap, but this book certainly is."
736.3."The Scarlet Letter In all honesty, this book was really hard to understand. Then again, I've never really been a big fan of the classics. But I got bored way too easily, and I honestly thought the last thirty or forty pages were the best part."
737.3."The Scarlet Letter In answer to your first question, yes I was forced to read this book by my Literature teacher.The Scarlet Letter, in its whole, is a metaphor for the urges we experience everyday, and the consequences for indulging ourselves.While this book may be listed as Historical Fiction, I believe it is a Romance. It has elements of both, but its just interesting enough not to be Historical Fiction (Boring being the the most important criterian.)The Scarlet Letter is a Romance because of, simply, urge. Adultery is the word (contrary to popular belief, it is not Grease.)Personally, I thought the Scarlet Letter was mediocre. A book written 150 years ago isn't fared to do well in a modern-day English class (most of my class didn't like it). I think, that when it was written, it was a good book. If my mindset were set some odd century and a half ago, I probably would have appreciated it more."
738.4."The Scarlet Letter One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time."
739.3."a rewarding, yet dragging book. The scarlet letter is a book which skips around alot. Based in MASS. it is about adultury and how it affects everyone around who ever commited it. Hester Prynne falls in love with the reverand dimmesdale and end up having a daughter, pearl. The one problem is that Hester is married. She feels that it is ok to love dimmesdale due to her husbands rumored death. Soon her husband returns, very much alive, yet hidding the fact of being hesters husband. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet letter A, A standing for adultry, on her clothes for the rest of her life. This book was good, yet at times you get lost and there is much unneeded text in there. If the author was to take out much of the unnessecary text, then this book would be great.. nice story line."
740.5."Be true ""The Scarlet Letter"", by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book about how keeping secrets can ruin a person. A very realistic view of how a society can treat others. Even though many of the towns people were no more innocent than Hester in many ways, they looked on her as one of the worse sinners in town, unable to be touched by the rest of society."
741.4."The ""Scarlet"" Letter Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear."
742.3."I expected a better one! I thought this book would be much better. Even thought it is a classic book, It was just fine for me."
743.4."A better read as an adult -- not a great choice for teenagers... Well-paced, surprisingly easy to follow despite the language used. I hadn't read it in 30 years, and found it to be much more palatable as an adult than it was when I was a teenager. There must be a lesson in there somewhere..."""
744.1."Don't pay for this on the Kindle Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on."
745.2."Slow, Overwritten Drama It started with a great plot...until he actually wrote it. It was overwritten (it takes pages before something happens) and the protagonists were hard to like. Boring, sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose. There are a couple twists, but the main characters are such morons, it underscores the little action that does happen."
746.2."Great Story ... Bad writing So sue me ... I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels. But you'll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway, so borrow it from the library."
747.1."Awful I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word ""Classic"" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was ""meaty"" (whatever that is), ""deep"", and ""powerful""; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle."
748.3."The Scarlet Letter The Scarlet Letter.Good story, but long-winded. I found the book difficult to read as the plot was tediously developed in my opinion. The long introduction did not excite me."
749.2."So boring I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring."
750.2."The okay book Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book. It has an okay plot and okay characters, but the book is not one for teens of the 90's. I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it. The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider."
751.1."I HATE THIS BOOK I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying."
752.1.Don't READ THIS BOOK!! THIS BOOK SUX! Who cares about Pearl anyways! Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom!!!
753.1."slowly falling asleep The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it."
754.1."one of the worst books I've ever read typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for ""fun"", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it."
755.1."I only gave it a star because I had to. This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!"
756.1."paralyzing fear The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that, while reading, I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr. Hawthorne's ""work"". Please, for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES!!! It will save you from years of therapy. I am scarred for live. My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation."
757.1."This book is a wast of good paper Oh man, where do i begin with this one? First of all, I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means. The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read. I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel, but if you can't stay awake to find it, what's the point? Also, it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence. Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient. This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities (another ""Classic"")."
758.1."Painful This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online."
759.5."Don't let your highschool teachers force feed you classics The Scarlet Letter is a very good book. It would be much better though if we were alowed to read it on our own and draw our own conclusions. How well can you appreciate a book if you have to hurry because you must read 40 pages in one night while making sure to remember details that may be on the test. Read it in highschool or not, it doesn't matter. But make sure to pick it up later in your life when you are ready for it, and you can draw your own conclusions instead of regurgitating what the teacher told you so you can pass a test."
760.3."Good literature, but not a pleasure read. Having re-read this book for the first time in two decades, I have no trouble understanding why it is a staple of high school literature classes everywhere. It's a great book for teaching symbolism, foreshadowing and some of the themes of the romantic movement. However, as an adult, I pretty much found it to be an excruciating reading experience, and I'm not just talking about the fact that the language is dense and dreary. The very things that make it a valuable teaching tool can be very annoying to a more experienced reader. As I was reading I kept wanting to scream every time Hawthorne talked about the scarlet letter burning, glowing or being like a painful brand. I got it already! I can put up with slogging through the nineteenth century prose if I'm going to be challenged a little, but this book no longer did it for me."
761.1."Incredibly confusing; have a dictionary on hand! This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me. Read this book at your own risk, but i do not reccommend it to anyone."
762.1."Ick. Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring."
763.4."The Scarlet Letter BrittleeMs. Self's English HonorsKickapoo High SchoolJunior11/21/05Warning: The book has a very high level of vocabulary!The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book about sinning and dealing with the internal and external consequences of natural sin in a society of Puritans. The book is about a woman named, Hester, who commits the sin of adultery. Adultery is not acceptable in the Puritan society. They view it as a sin. To punish Hester for her wrongful acts, they place a scarlet A on her chest to let everyone know that she is an adulterer. Hester has a baby girl and names her Pearl. Pearl soon starts to grow up and realize why her mother has the A on her chest. Pearl starts questioning her mother about the A. Hester then realizes that the A on her chest is not a symbol of shame but of identity. Identity in a world where everyone is the same, they act the same, believe in the same virtues. The scarlet letter only made Hester stronger."
764.4."A Colossal Classic! ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a superior book that explodes in emotion, passion, love, hatred, and crime. Hawthorne's choice of vocabulary is absolutely perfect to suit this novel. However, like all great classics, the reader must be patient. The story is very powerful, like an iron fist, telling of sins of adultery, and the great Dimmsedale, a character in this book, ""who keeps is hand over thy heart."" Full of fierce yet excellent story telling, this book is a must for all lovers of classics and American Literature"
765.1."The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping Pill! This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!"
766.5."Scarlet Letter While I had a copy of the Scarlet Letter in my personal library, my son's teacher required the Dover edition. I was very pleased with the vendor's delivery, arriving before the due date. My son expressed ease with which he was able to read, especially when the class used the same edition as a text. Thank you!"
767.4."Beautifully Done The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words."
768.2."Need a dictionary! The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book. While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!"
769.3."Slow, but good the scarlet letter has been sitting on my bookshelf for about 2yrs now so earlier this summer I decided Imight as well read it since it was considered a classic and all. It was a pretty good book overall but definitely nothing like the movie. I hate to say it but, I suffered through this book. It was one of the most boring books I've ever read in my life. But, after I finished it and thought about it a while I decided it really was a good story eventhough the book itself wasslow. But then again I read the unabridged version."
770.5."Quite The Story ..... Where does one begin ? how does one begin ? This novel of Hawthorne is an excellent one .. a classic...a novel to be cherished . The lessons to be learnt about sin ,giult ,denial and eventual deliverance of truth ,redemption and socialization can all be internalized into real life . Yes , Hawthorne was not a perfect Writer but he portrays the language skillfully and beautifully . I must stress that to reaal understand this book, you shouldn't be cranking up the volume on your stereo and drinking caffeine drinks ....if you do . you'll fell the book is "" the worst book you could ever read """
771.4."Once you get into this book it's awsome! Although rather difficult to understand, The Scarlet Letter was an incredibly interesting book. Hawthorne writes in a way that his characters are very realistic and relatable. I just finished reading it for American Lit. and I have to admitt I was far from thirilled about the idea but I found by the time I got to about the 5th chapter that I really couldn't wait to find time to read more. If you like to read about human nature and how one decsion really can determine your life and that of those around you than you should definetly look into reading The Scarlet Letter."
772.2."Leave this one to the bibliophiles Yes, I am a 17 yr old high school kid. But I can tell good books from the bad ones. ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a ""classical"" tale of 2 lovers. To be concise, this novel is too wordy to be enjoyable. People can say it's a classic romantic novel, it has good character developments, it has good themes and ironies, blah blah blah. I, like most people, don't judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors; all in all leave this book to a ""Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy"". If youre looking for a more entertaining classic, read ""Huck Finn"" by Twain."
773.2."Yes, I was another victim who had to read this for school Ok, when I first started this book I thought it was the dumbest thing and I could not belive this was a classic! (I still can't) After a few chapters I thought it was a little better and thats why I gave it two stars. Also, it is one of the better books that I had to read for school. I still feel that it was a little boring and hard to follow but with the class discussions I understood it a lot more. I still wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone"
774.4."Better than I remembered. I did not remember how good this classic was until I read it again. I originally read it in high school many years ago, and it was better the second time around.."
775.5."School Reading I had to read this book for the first time in high school and even then I fell in love with the story. Yes the onld english can bog you down a bit, but it is so worth it. it has a great story line. It's what can be considered old school scandalous!"
776.3."High School Lit revisited Still a powerful novel, a landmark of American literature. Hawthorne has such insight, way ahead of his time. And to think we are now reading him on Kindle...."
777.2."I had to read it... I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other."
778.5."The Scarlet Letter This book typifies the old English, colonialists, trying to impose their disgusting lawsThis is a must read book, for those who consider these authors worthy. The English have always been accomplished writers"
779.5."A Masterpiece for all times Gets better with every reading! Required reading in high school aeons ago - so it seemed terribly tedious. Am now entranced with every word."
780.5."An On line Read This went back to an old standard. It was a good read and easy to view on the reader. I enjoyed it as it was what I expected."
781.5."Great book I love this book. It's a great classic, and I love Hawthorne's style. Very well written, and a good representation of the time."
782.2."Not interesting at all I was supposed to read this for English class,and had some interest because I`ve heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very good.But once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boring,I got the book on audio to assist me.I only got to chapter 3 and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the end.Its uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no direction.I highly recomend getting Cliff Notes(which I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book) and possibly the movie(It might not be the same to the book, but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better)."
783.2."This book is incredibly boring! This is one of the all-time most boring books. I do not recommend reading it at all. The introduction is incredibly long, and incredibly boring. Also, it doesn't really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can't put down. I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book. I had much higher expectations for this book. If you are looking for a classic to read, I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo, not this book."
784.2."Both forward and backward in its ideas First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered ""a classic,"" such as Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina,"" both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories."
785.1."How Can Sex and Sin Be So Boring? Throughout this entire book, one part of my brain was in a state of wonder, trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal, sin, adultery, public shame and cowardice so dull. To finish the book was a test of will, and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone.There are many fine, engaging, interesting novels, both of our age and of Hawthorne's. I can't imagine why one would want to slog through this one."
786.3."Scarlette Letter, (Classic Collection Discs) I am not reviewing the book itself but the disc. My teenager is dyslexic and is required to read this for high school. It would be so helpful if somewhere on the package we were told what chapters are on what discs."
787.4."El Gaucho De Nuestro Argentina Es un libro de puntos muy astutos en relacion al vida interior del pais Argentina. Los Paisanos del Interior como Chaco y Resistencia Puedan apreciar estos escritos de nuestro historia. Un libro muy Importante al juventud hoy dia."
788.4."Good, but old If you keep your perspective in check, this is an excellent resource. Good, basic advice. I was struggling training my girlfriend (I am advanced, she a beginner), and this book made it much easier to convince her that I wasn't crazy with my training advice. It is a simple and clear book, pretty basic, but I am a big believer that 90% of the results come from the basic stuff, and the last 10% is for when you hit sticking points, or reach an advanced level. But the book is getting on in age these days; still, don't let that disuade you if you can pick up a copy."
789.2."Boring I love Arnold and what he has accomplished so it suprised me to suggest that women should start out using 3 lb weights. Sorry, you won't get results like that. This book my be good for seniors or those with limited physical ability."
790.3."Return Of The Killer Tomatoes I Was Very Satisfied With My Purchase.It Arrived With Good Timing.(Didnt Take Too Long)My Husband Was Happy To Receive It As A Christmas As He Requested.I Am Glad We Were Able To Find An Older Movie We Were Looking For,As I We Are Trying To Start Our Movie Collection That Includes Older,Indie& ""B"" Movies."
791.3."Not as funny as I thought it would be This is an imitation of a movie-that-is-so-bad-it's-funny, but the movie just isn't all that bad. On the other hand it isn't super clever either. It splits the difference and as a result is humorous, but not a side splitter. The scenes from the original Attack of the Killer Tomatoes looked funnier and someday I will give that one a look."
792.4."for the 80's cheezy horror film fans I bought this as an xmas gift for my brother and he loved it! It's a great package of cheezy horror films from the 1980's."
793.5."Better than the first in every way! In every way, 'Return of the Killer Tomatoes' is a far better film then the classic original. The characters, ranging from John Astin as the evil mad scientist, his clean cut news anchor servant Igor, and George Clooney in his first film role, are hilarious. The plot is more involved and understandable, and the jokes fly fast and furious. One thing potential buyers should be aware of is that this film, like the original, is presented in the fullscreen format common with straight-to-video productions, which this almost certainly was. A great film, a better sequel, and well worth the few dollars it costs."
794.4."Hilarious!! Anthony Starke is great! The deadpan expression of Tony Starke makes the offbeat script bearable. Great party movie. For a ""B' movie, this beats a few recent ""A"" movies I've seen"
795.1."DECEPTION! Warning -- the two songs listed as ""Little Steve"" were written by him but are not the originals nor performed by him!"
796.2."Not what we expected The suction on this dish does not really work. The only thing I could get it to suction to was glass. we never really wanted it for the warming part, just for the suction. All in in all, we were not very satisfied with this purchase."
797.2."Not user friendly The dish is not easy to take apart for cleaning and I wish I could put in it the microwave."
798.4."Great baby dish I bought this for my grandson and it is great. Easy to clean and keeps the food warm."
799.3."baby dish I wish this item was a little bit bigger than what it was. The price was a good price. I was really wanting a gerber baby dish, but could not find one anywhere. If someone knows where to look, please let me know. Thank you."
800.3."Works okay, but not up to expectations I read all the mixed reviews and still gave this product a shot. It works okay, but even with hot tap water it doesn't stay warm very long. Forget about the suction feature - it is lousy. I bought it to keep the food warm, which it does to a certain extent. Wish you could microwave it though."
801.3."Nice dish, but didn't stick for long As with the Munchkin product, this is a great feeding dish. Initially, the dish was secure on the high chair tray, but after a short period of time, it was very movable. It did stick on the tile counter fairly well, but that is not where we wanted to use it."
802.2."NOT USER FREINDLY This product is a good idea however:1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dishwith hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray.2. Can't be put in the Micro.3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean.4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use abutter knife to pry open).5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems.6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long.Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product!"
803.2."Disappointed Maybe in time I will figure this plate out, but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart, use the suction, clean it out. It may seem simple, but a harried mother needs these details! I am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me, at least as far as being a stay-put dish, which is why I purchased it."
804.2."Not User Friendly. NOTHING that says it's BPA-free Nearly impossible to disassemble for cleaning.Hole for water is tiny.Bottom gets very hot to handle, food takes awhile to warm up, then remains warm for only about 20 minutes.MOST importantly, IS THIS DISH BPA-FREE OR NOT? I've seen it listed on BPA-free lists on the web, BUT, there is nothing on the package or product description that deems it so."
805.3."Looks cute and usable! its looks can be deceiving. The filling of water can become a messy event. Its food compartment arent very big. The suction cup effect doent work well at all.I bought two and gave them away."
806.3."Ok product This product is not my favorite. I do like how the food stays warm since my son is a slow eater. But the suction part does not work at all. My son can easily pick the dish up and throw it on the floor. I recommend it for young babies before they want to grab everything."
807.1."same problems as munchkin version Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin"
808.3."baby dish Ihave a great deal of trouble seprating the top from the bottom. I ordered 2 and one I have never been able to seperate. Thanks"
809.3."Just the basics Pretty much geared for younger teens. A very basic overview - the most interesting part was the period from his childhood to his early adult years. Not much insight into his writings"
810.4."An Excellent Survery of Women Rabbis For anyone interested in the history of the ordination of women as rabbis, this book is excellent. It is written primarily from, and dealing with women in the British rabbinate, but is beneficial and applicable to all. It raises interesting discussions about women's involvement in Jewish leadership, and even highlights the first woman rabbi in modern times - who was ordained in Germany in 1935. It would not be until the 1970's that women would be ordained in America. As an American Jew, I found this book very interesting and I gained insights into the Jewish community of Britain."
811.3."Brutal ok this is a pretty good split CD, picked it up at the Tower outlet store for 25 cents. Not bad for 25 cents but I wouldn't pay more than two bucks for it. RCR definitely stronger than Bulemics."
812.1."1996 edition of book is outdated The book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years. Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2, then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading!"
813.1."Disappointing This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style."
814.1."Arrived broken! Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries."
815.2."complicated I still haven't figured out how to put this light together. When I do, the wires appear very delicate and I doubt it will even work. The directions are atrocious. But at least it doesn't require batteries, so you can feel good about not destroying the environment too much."
816.1.junk this thing is nothing but s piece of junk it came broke,didnt,work i wouldnt of rated it but i had to:[DO NOT BUY THIS ITEAM-it is nothing but a piece of junk
817.2."Used for circuits project I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment."
818.5.great i think it is a great comidy just anther adam sandler if you dont like him then this prob isnt a great movie for you but i would still try it
819.1."Nauseating! If you are adamant to watch this movie despite all the negative reviews, please do it after the Holliday season. This is the most depressing, sad, pathetic, sarcastic and cruel movie that I've ever seen in my life.Through all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day. Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood, twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom. How somebody could find it funny is beyond me.If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you! If not - skip it."
820.1."A very disappointing movie Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me. Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes."
821.2."Clean it up! The Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible (sickest humor he's done in any of his movies that I've seen). Definately not for kids. I expected better after Mr. Deeds. Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash. I love the Chanukah Song! I'm not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate Chanukah.There are only two real redeeming features of the movie. These are the little old man Whitey, because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like ..., and Stone's repentence (for lack of a better word) at the end."
822.1."Parents - Don't Let Your Kids Watch This Movie Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children's holiday cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none."
823.3."BAWDY, GOOFBALL HANNUKAH HOLIDAY Adam Sandler's autobiographical EIGHT CRAZY NIGHTS (Columbia Tristar) is a rowdy, goofball mix of awkward sentiment and scatological humor set against a Hanukkah celebration. Apparently bad childhood memories compel Davey Stone (Sandler) to screw up the holidays. Will he find redemption? Hysterical voice work by Sandler, Rob Schneider and Jon Lovitz. Oh yes, it's a musical."
824.4."sandler is da bomb 8 crazy nights was a movie that was touching and hilarious. Adam Sandler was good and should be seen by families."
825.3."An enjoyable movie but missing something... I enjoyed the movie. Some of the jokes were funny, and it was only 1 hour and 16 minutes. The real problem with this movie isn't the crude humor, but the songs.I personally hate movies that just break out into songs every few minutes, and this is one of them. Basically I am assuming you can visit any other review for the synopsis, but if you hate songs then don't get this. About 25 minutes of it mabye is songs, just to let you know."
826.1."i want my money back Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore."
827.2."terrible movie I used to be a fan of The Simpsons, but now much more of a South Park kinda guy, so it's near impossible to offend me really.. The humor was good in some spots, but overall I fould it to be annoying and pointless. The emotion and general plot was pretty good, and I've always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work, but this movie was bad (some of the singing was okay, but personally I didn't like half of it). Most of the content is incredibly gross and could make you vomit if eating, but that's Sandler's great gold."
828.1."Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie! This movie was terrible!""WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!""Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean. Then when he gets into trouble he's doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney, (No offence to little people out there, that it not my intention to offend anyone). Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable! So warning to parents, keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie!"
829.1."ugh The packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in was distorted. I wanted to give this as a christmas present but it doesn't even look new!"
830.5."how it works Love it. Works great. Have watched several times on at least three different players. Would like to have more movies of Adam Sandle."
831.4."Fantastic A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie."
832.3."Five star feel good movie, 1 star gross-out movie As with many of Adam Sandler's movies, there are two aspects that you watch. The first aspect is the one that makes you laugh and makes you feel good about life. Then there is the one that goes for the gross-out humor that three year olds giggle at while covering their mouths and peeking to make sure mom-and-dad isn't watching. This movie was no exception.The movie was funny and I liked the underlying message. Unfortunately, I had to just shake my head at all of the jokes where Adam Sandler and team/writers are reaching desperately for a laugh.So, if you can withstand that type of humor, or heaven forbid, actually like it, then pick up this movie. If you can't take it, don't bother... it wouldn't be worth it."
833.3."Not That Bad This movie really isn't as bad as everyone said. Critics, Word of Mouth etc. but while definently not Sandler's best it allowed him to show more of his talent through different voices and the great animation kept the movie going. Whitey was a bit annoying at first but you get used to him and the movie's musical moments are fine. I just wish it were longer, giving more time for the story to develop. Ah well for what it is it was good enough for me to see twice in theaters."
834.4."JUST a cartoon that tells a message....... I liked it very much! It not for the very young kids. More for teenagers and up.Adam sandler is very talented and it's made up of HIS sense of humor. So if people are NOT a fan of his,...I don't think they would enjoy it.I found it too be very interesting. At first I was tired of Daveys character being SO mean to everyone. But his heart softens at the end and it would teach any bully a lession!I loved the character of Whitey, (voice of Adam Sandler). He is so cute and lovable! His sister, Eleanore,(Adam Sadlers voice again), is SO funny!!! I love it when Whitey sings, ""Technical Foul"",...both so adorable!!This is JUST a cartoon that is NOT meant to be taken serious except for the heart-warming message/story that its trying to get across!...people can be so mean to the nicest people who don't deserve it!!!I REALLY liked it a lot. I WILL be adding this movie too my collection!!"
835.5."BEST HOLIDAY FILM IN YEARS!!!!!!!!!!! 8 Crazy Nights is one of the greatest holiday films I have ever seen in my life. It ranks up there as one of the greatest holiday films with Jingle All The Way, Christmas Vacation, and Home Alone. The jokes are HILARIOUS and the plot is so beautiful. I cried from laughing sooooo much and cried from the wonderful storyline. This movie is pure genius."
836.5."Finally! Oh, my goodness. To all of you reading out there, I have been waiting for this movie's release date for almost a whole year. Ever since the film came out in theaters, I checked amazon.com every day to find out when it would be released and now, I know. Also, this DVD comes out on my birthday. That is cool. Anyway, all my friends who saw this movie and all the reviews I read said that this movie was terrible. I say forget those reviews because this movie is simply amazing. If you like Adam Sandler, then this movie is for you. If you don't like Adam Sandler this movie is still for you. This is by far his best movie ever (Happy Gilmore is his second best). This is a must buy for any Sandler fan. It is warm and witty and has the voice talents of so many people from Adam Sandler's SNL days. Classic movie. You can count on me being there at the store before school buying this. Can't wait!"
837.2."Childrens Humor Not Suitable For Children. I want to say first that I am an Adam Sandler fan. I loved him on SNL, I have enjoyed him in everything from ""Billy Madison"" to ""Punch-Drunk Love"". So with that in mind, I had high hopes for ""Eight Crazy Nights"". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler's Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don't, you'll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny, but I don't. Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last."
838.1."Nightmare Before Hannukah I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this ""feature"" to anyone. ""Eight Crazy Nights"" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch ""Ishtar,"" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest."
839.1."Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate. Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this."
840.1."Worse Movie I've Seen In Ages I gave this 1 star because they wouldn't let me have 0 stars. The movie is just plain horrible. The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile, flatulence and other bodily function humor. But, this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves. It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film."
841.1."Sucks Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks."
842.1."Illegible It was an illegible **photocopy**. It appeared as if someone took a picture of every page of an original ""Principles of Science"", then faxed those pictures to the printer in order to produce this book.I returned it immediately."
843.1."Why so expensive??! Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy."
844.1."Spun Out The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged ""Adam And Evil""); (2) Deborah Walley's ""girl drummer"" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues ""I'll Be Back"". Everything else is redundant."
845.1."The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs... Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with ""...lots and lots of girls."" And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way."
846.3."Spinout Another Cool Elvis movie,with a cool car. this time a Cobra 427(I prefer Vettes'). I like Clambake better."
847.2."Not the worst, but far from good This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book ""The 50 worst films of all time"". It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos, and better than some of those!"
848.2."The music's better than the movie SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" and ""I'll Be Back"".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first."
849.5."Spinout Back in '66 when I was 16 I saw this film numerous times. Loved it!! Still enjoy it today. Funny. Great supporting cast. Pretty girls. Enjoyable soundtrack. Hilarious racing finale. What's not to like?To the reviewer(s) who consider this Elvis' worst film, I ask: Have you seen Harum Scarum? Now that one IS bad!!"
850.1."Piece of junk! This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort."
851.4."pure soul! mr. holmes was one of the masters of the hammond b-3 as this set attests. he melded the blues and jazz together in an endlessly swinging atmosphere, one that can't help but make you get off your seat and shake your behind! this album captures him in full roar toward the end of his life in 1988. ""blues all day long"" gets things off to a great start, setting the tone for the entire date. this is a soulful blues, best heard late in the evening when things are settling into a pleasant groove. ""killer joe"" shows mr. holmes could also handle funk/r-n-b. finally, ""groove's groove"" reveals just how much swing an organ can have. mr. holmes may never have gotten as much recognition as other b-3 masters like jimmy smith, jack mcduff, lonnie liston smith, or even shirley scott, but he certainly belongs in their ranks. if you can find them, his recordings for the pacific jazz label are also worth finding."
852.5."Great desk for the young scholar We bought this for our tall seven-year old and it is an excellent fit. It was not difficult to assemble and it is very sturdy and the finish is solid - it won't peel off with an accidental piece of tape or scratch. We have a similar set that is in espresso and love it. The kids spill stuff on it and stick things to it and it is still in good condition. This is a big sturdy desk and we highly recommend it."
853.4."Great First Desk I purchased this desk for my daughter for Christmas. It was easy to put together and looks great. It is a wonderful first desk that is very stable and well made. The materials even say that it is hand painted. Overall, I love it and my daughter was thrilled."
854.3."good price, cute, fair quality this was what I was looking for in terms of style, price, and size. I replaced the knob with a cuter one and ta-da! like pottery barn only much less expensive. sometimes you get what you pay for, however; the drawer has needed fixing numerous times. just not holding up. will last 2-3 years tops (which may be enough)."
855.4."Great Value for Less Money I searched hi and low for a desk that would work in my son's small room -- I wanted a desk made of wood and available in honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch (as a large hutch wouldn't work)...and at a reasonable price. The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect! I took off one star because I didn't realize how short it was - ok for my 9 yr old son now, but as he grows up I'm afraid he will outgrow the desk. It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows. I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height! Dear Kidcraft...please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be ""normal"" desk height for later years, making is a ""Teen""kraft desk ;-). Thanks."
856.4."Great value for good quality product Love this desk and chair set. Bought it for my KG'er who is enjoying using it for his arts and crafts projects as well as for homework. It is good quality, took less than an hour to put together and definitely sturdy material - this coming from a mom of a very rambunctious 5yr old. The only thing is that I can see my kid growing out of it in 2 or 3 yrs. It's not very high and the chair is small, so is more catered to younger kids, i would say probably 8yrs and younger."
857.4."Great desk for the money! We wanted a desk to place a computer on for our 5-year-old. Yes, 5-year-olds use computers nowadays! this was perfect for her, matched her room furniture and though it required some assembly, it went together very well. Probably would be too small in about 5 more years, but for now, it's perfect and well priced."
858.4."If it's good enough for Popeye... I always keeps a can of this fine product on me person. You never knows when some palooka wot ain't on the up and square is gonna need to be put in his place. It always leaves ya strong to the finish."
859.5."Mark of Love I would have to say that I love this movie for several reasons. First, it is a very cute story with some adorable characters. Second, my niece starred in it and produced it, and last but not least, my son has two songs in it!!!"
860.3."Hodge podge of O'Neill's decades-old letters I have used this book, it looks like copies of some correspondence between O'Neill and some of his business associates and friends--primarily having to do with his research trips to Japan. I compiled a list of the more useful openings and closings to letters, with appropriate seasonal greetings, but I believe many of these may be available as canned openings in MS Word. They are no doubt also available on the internet.Aside from these timeless items, this book is dated. The handwriting is also very neat, not like the chicken scratches I often have to translate from barely legible faxes or the notes someone has scribbled on a greasy, cafeteria napkin. So, this book is unlikely to help you too much in deciphering real handwritten Japanese.If this book is in your library, it might be worth looking into, but I do not recommend buying it."
861.4."A Must Have for ALL Aspects of Love Devotees! Being a huge Aspects of Love fan, I was extremely excited to find another cast recording. I was sceptical however, after reading reviews for this recording. After listening to it, all of my fears were put aside. This is a wonderful recording that possesses both brisk conducting and deep emotion from its musical director. I felt that the cast was extremely dramatic and that the piece was very well sung. Having listened to several other ALW cast recordings I feel that this cast was excellent. A must have for all Aspects of Love devotees!"
862.3."Chef'n Mini Pepper Ball I am satisfied with this product. The only negative I would mention is that I wish it were bigger so as to be more quickly accessible when cooking. The size I purchased(did not see a larger size offered) is more suited for the dinner table, while enjoying a meal."
863.1."Slow I bought this grinder because it could be operated with one hand. However I was very disappointed in the volume of pepper it puts out per squeeze. If you are looking for a good wrist strength training exerciser this is your grinder."
864.4."It Rises above the ""Fluff"" Books The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on ""emotional states"" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book's far from perfect, but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic."
865.4."Get off the dead horse of ""old school"" education To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so ""no child is left behind"" this book is a starting point about how people learn. The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a ""fad"", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of ""accountability"" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in ""leveling the field"" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of ""survivalists of poverty"". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to ""get off the dead horse"" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century."
866.2."Brain Based Learning: The New Paradigm of Teaching I am currently reading the Kindle version of this book. The book itself is very easy to read and full of material to try in the class room. Unfortunately, there are no page numbers that correspond to the paper version of the book. As this is a text book, it is impossible to cite material and the page from which it was taken. This is really unacceptable for a text book. It is one thing if it were a literature book, and even then, it would be better to have the physical page number of the actual book. If I had known that there were no page numbers contained in this Kindle version, I would NOT have purchased it. I would have purchased a used hard copy."
867.1."""Science"" ""On average, we breathe through one nostril for about three hours until the tissue becomes slightly engorged; then we switch to the other side. The nostril we breathe through affects which brain hemisphere we use."" (p25)""[T]he female brain processes both language and feeling at the same time far more efficiently than the male brain does."" (p20)These two quotes should tell you what you need to know about the quality of the ""science"" contained in this book.Lord, if this is what we teach our teachers..."
868.5."""Brain Based Learning"" is a masterpiece ""Brain Based Learning"" suggests a new style of teaching that activates student brains and makes them an active participant in the learning process. Author Eric Jensen is absolutely brilliant with his delivery of this material. His writing style is engaging, profound and insightful. I'm so impressed with the way to weaves together a variety of sources to present his idea for personal transformation. Never before have I read a book that combines material on stress reduction, fight-or-flight, activating both hemispheres of the brain, and flow states-- and applied it to education.Seriously, this book is a masterpiece! You don't have to be a teacher to gleam something from ""Brain Based Learning"" -- it is also insightful for entrepeniurs, marketers and writers. If you listen to brain synch cds, use light and sound machines, or do any sort of AVE (audio visual entrainment), reading this book will rock your world. I highly recommend this book!"
869.1."Two thumbs down - way down! This book was in one word - boring. It talks about the first academy awards...blah, blah, blah...and then the latest. The book is filled with usless babble that isn't even worth knowing! Listen people - DO NOT waste your money buying this book and/or your time reading this book! What a wasteful piece of crap..."
870.5."It's the Oscar buff's Bible. It's not really meant to be read from beginning to end, though you certainly can. It's a handy reference that will draw you in. You may begin by looking up the last year Bob Hope hosted, but an hour later you'll realize you're in the Billy Crystal era. Lots of fun -- dishy but accurate. Pick it up, turn to any chapter, and enjoy."
871.1."This is a Bootleg,Don't buy. I would like to recommend to anyone who have thought of buying this box set, to stay away. I've been a die-hard Metallica fan since the 80's, and i have never bought a bootleg album w/out hearing something off of it. I'm also in the Official Metallica Club, we are notified weeks before anyone else that a new album is coming out. They never mensioned this one, so then again i'd advise you to stay away from this item. The Garage Inc. CD is great. I've got all the versions of it except this one. I of course don't plan on getting it though. Who in their right mind would pay almost $140 for an item not even licensed by the band. I hope everyone who was thinking about buying this reads this first, so you all don't get ripped off."
872.2."This is NOT a bootleg This is simply not a bootleg. It was an overseas limited box set release. The band (or label) has done similar box sets. They did one for the Hero Of The Day single, limiting it to 1,000 copies. They also have plans to release a limited vinyl box soon. This is simply a collectable, nothing more than that. There are no music extras in this box.As a limited box it doesn't really offer very much at all. The CD you can purchase anywhere and the packaging of the actual disc(s) is no different than the standard (Vertigo) version. Do we really need a hat and a flag?For die hard collectors only."
873.2."Way over my head! This book was recommended by an instructor. I am new to this crazy pursuit of oil painting. My instructor called this her ""bible"" of color theory, but I honestly didn't understand much of it. Way too detailed, written in language that may be appropriate for someone who has a degree in fine art or art education, but certainly not for a beginner."
874.2."Itten, the elements of color The information in this book is interesting, but the color in the color wheels and all color samples are very pale and washed off. Very disappointing.If you need to use the color wheels or scales as references, this book will not be helpful."
875.2."Technical book written by someone who does not know how to write a technical book. It is too bad that this is practically the only one of the kind. The aim is great, the contents are great, but the author does not know how to write a technical book. The author refers to concepts and terms that are yet to be defined or never defined at all. For example, at the very beginning, the author talks about ""violet"" and ""purple"". Am I the only one who did not know ""violet"" means a color of a single frequency, whereas ""purple"" is a color of combined frequencies? This is a No-No for mathematicians and scientists. For those of who are already familiar with Color Theory, the book must be a great assurance, articulation or enhancement of their existing knowledge, but for those who are new and try to learn as an artist, this is a nightmare. I am the latter kind. The only reason I could finish it was because I am familiar with fundamental physics and optics already."
876.4."Great book for first time retriever owner I've had 4 hunting labs over the past 20 years, and this is the one book I always recommend to first-time retriever owners who want to hunt their dog. The book is especially good from the first day you get your puppy up until about a year. He covers questions at the end of each chapter that are typical of new retriever owners: What if pup eats the bird?, what if pup runs away from me with a bumper, etc. Advanced topics like drills for blind retrieves (swimby, casting and lining drills,pattern blinds, etc.) or hunt tests(multiple marks, retired guns, holding blinds, etc) are not covered. The book cautions against using an electric collar. I agree. I've seen too many pups with great potential totally confused by a newbie incorrectly using the ecollar. If you do plan on using an ecollar, I recommend Tritronics Retriever Training book by Jim and Phyllis Dobbs."
877.5."I got lucky! I was able to buy this textbook for only ten dollars including shipping! My classmates were skeptical of such a low price and assured me the book would be in terrible condition. But they were wrong! There is not one note, highlight, or writing on the margins. The book looks practically new."
878.5."AWESOME The book I received was in excellent condition and arrived fast. Unfortunately, my professor did not require the text only an on line Virtual Child. I returned the book and was given a prompt refund. Thank you so much for your great customer service."
879.4."Good deal, fast shipping Can't really get too excited about this (because it was from a class a number of year ago) but Amazon did deliver a good quality copy for many $'s cheaper than the campus book store."
880.2."Book in great condition, but took 20 days to get it This book was brand new when I received it. However, it did not arrive for 20 days after I ordered it."
881.3.Review for Infants, Children, & Adolescents Good seller, quick delivery, could have put a better description about book on Web
882.1."Don't buy it ! This pepper mill does not work well at all, it takes a lot of hand crunching to get the pepper ground and the refill 'twist off' plastic cap on the bottom on mine does not even open.The lip of the plastic cap hits the side of the pepper mill plastic body not allowing the refill cap to come off ! I used it until it ran out of pepper and that's it. Writing the manufacturer to get a refund. Shoddy construction. Get yourself a good old-fashioned wooden pepper mill."
883.3."LESS THAN PERFECT. THE ROUND ALUMINUM GRILL WHILE LARGE ENOUGH, DOES BEND AWAY FROM THE HEAT. THE DISTORTION IS ENOUGH TO COOL-DOWN 1/3 OF THE SURFACE. IS WAS ADVERTISED BY THE MAKER AS NON DISTORTING. NOT QUITE TRUE. NOT TOTALLY BAD, THOUGH, AS I AM USING IT OFTEN. THE HANDLE GETS VERY HOT AND ONE MUST TAKE REASONABLE CARE IN HANDLING IT. THE TRUTH IS I AM TRYING TO TURN A 'LECTRIC GLASS-TOP INTO A FLAT GRILLE. TAKES PRACTICE ! (CAN'T USE IRON ON GLASS)"
884.1."Hard to clean We had to buy a new lunchbox for our son after 2 months (a different brand, machine-washable) because this one is way too hard to clean. I have turned it completely inside out, scrubbed between all the cracks, and still food is stuck in the seams andthreads. It is very durable, but we can't get rid of the smell or stains with a reasonable amount of effort."
885.3."Cute and handy lunch bag, fits everything As our 15-month old eats more and more, we outgrew the small cold bag we'd used for smaller bottles and little bits of food. We went looking for a lunchbox that would hold 2 8-oz bottles as well as a couple of small food containers, as well as an ice pack or two. This lunchbox does the trick, and our son loves the animals.The only missing element, at least for me, is a shoulder strap - our smaller lunchbag has a short strap that we used to sling the bag around, which especially came in handy when loading kid and lunchbag and diaperbag and purse etc. onto an airplane. I think we can improvise one, but it won't be terribly elegant."
886.3."Needs More Flavor If this were not coming off the heels of what I consider to be one of the best albums (El Cielo) in the last 5 years, I may have thought more highly of ""Catch."" But it is. Simply put, ""El Cielo"" was a decadent banana split with 3 kinds of your favorite ice cream topped with syrup, cherries, whipped cream and a few nuts sprinkled on top. Lottsa stuff to like.""Catch"" is plain 'ol vanilla. Not a banana split but it's still ice cream. I've had to eat much worse. But I still want that next banana split, dredg. At least throw some damn chocolate syrup on top!"
887.4."More fun but less magical than El Cielo Let me just say first that El Cielo is one of my desert-island albums. The soaring melodies, the heart-melting vocals, the passion... This album feels more commercial to me. I still like it a lot, but the magic that made me fall for El Cielo isn't really here anymore, though I'm glad it won the band many more fans. I will say though that this one feels a bit more focused than El Cielo- the band has matured a little bit, but I guess I just found the first one more passionate, whereas this one is more professional."
888.3."Catchy embrace 3 1/2Floats by enjoyably enough with many blasts of melodic rock-pop and less memorable bridge material in what sounds like their last stab at brilliant accessibility."
889.4."Great Effort Simply one of the better bands around today. Do yourself a favor and pick any of their music. I'm sure you'll find it a pleasant surprise."
890.3."Not quite there ... yet Having listened through the tracks on ""Catch without arms"" a couple of times, I am struck by the lack of songs having the same instant appeal as the songs on ""El Cielo"". This is surprising, considering how the average track length seems to have been pared down from earlier Dredg efforts. This should, in theory, make for more accessible songs.That is not to say that ""instant appeal"" is my lithmus test for Dredg songs. It is just that I was floored when listening to Dredg's previous release ""El Cielo"" for the first time. The mix of moodiness and well-crafted songs was perfect.Standout tracks on ""Catch Without Arms"" are ""Bug Eyes"" and ""Sang Real"". Coincidentally, these are also the tracks that remind me the most of the vibe that Dredg caught on ""El Cielo"".Really, I don't know what to make of this cd yet. Perhaps it just needs some time to ripen."
891.4."Great CD This album is a wonderful piece of work. Great production---especially the drums, nice compressed snare. Great songwriting---this goes without saying for anyone familiar with Dredg. The lyrics are spot-on---every lyric fits perfect with everything. Go check out their earlier releases as well. It's all good. I hope Dredg can continue to make good music in the otherwise terribly trendy and unoriginal industry.ps. to ""teerav""---->While I agree that this album is great, you really should check out the Silverchair CD, ""Diorama"" you were making fun of. It's really really good man."
892.4."Very Listenable but not amazing..... The main problem with listening to this cd is that much of the vocals and songs sound alike. The good thing is that they all sound pretty good. I can listen to every song and for the most part enjoy them, but in the distant future I can see myself getting tired of this cd (but hey, you will get tired of any song in general if you listen to them enough times). I find that a lot of bands fall into the trap of making too much of a good thing. What sets Dredg apart is that they can get away with it in my opinion on this occasion."
893.2."Evolving?? If the word evolving means that you simplify song structures and lyrics and make it more dull and lame then this band is really good at that. How can you say this band is evolving ? Yes it is album that is more easy to listen to when washing the dishes or just hanging around with friends drinking beer, but even so becomes boring. I have a feeling that Dredg has one of the biggest amount of fanboys ever. What they say is totaly irrelevant. I have NEVER wanted this new album to be like El cielo. And i really doubt that other dissapointed reviewers too wanted another El cielo. It is just soulless guys."
894.2."Hot lava Indeed I completely agree... the album seems so unlike such a thoughfull and talented band. Not to say i've lost faith in dredg , just i need some time to get over this travesty."
895.1."Just horrible I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame."
896.3."Ultraman fans will forgive the gameplay The only redeeming quality of this game is being able to play your favorite Ultra characters in a game that feels like the first release of Mortal Kombat back in the 90's. The developers raised the bar high on the challenge of letting the user figure out how to start a game and how to win a match. Let's say that you will bang your head against the wall a lot. Even in ""easy"" mode, it's very difficult to defeat the bad guy, not to mention it's nearly impossible to figure out how to use the combination attacks, since there are no instructions. But it's fun to see the Ultras and the monsters moving around. Get it only if you really like Ultraman."
897.4."Good book for coping Though it has typos and does not always focus on the child. It shows how the parents are coping."
898.2."until you've walked in my shoes As a father of a daughter with autism, i was surprised by how little time the author contributed to the family life. More time was spent at work and then writing a book when it sounds like home would have been the place to be at this critical time for his family. He writes often about don't critize until you've walked in my shoes yet he has no problems bashing the GFCF diet which has proved helpful to many families. while written with great love for his son, i am not sure his priorities are in order."
899.1."The book is irrelevant; how about the author? In reading use comments about Yanni's album ""If I Could Tell You"" I noticed this author advertised his book. Regardless of the book's merits, I think it should be rejected due to the author being a shallow, inappropriate capitalist.PS I'm proud of myself for not swearing at Mr. Mcandrew in this post."
900.3."An extremely moving read This book took me inside what the McAndrews are coping with. I found it extremely moving and, while I do not have any first-hand experience with autism, felt that it illuminates the joys as well as the challenges of living with autism. Although McAndrew needs to find a good editor, the personal ""journaling"" style of his writing is accessible and heartfelt."
901.1."TERRIBLE DONT BOTHER neither artist are together on this cd u get five tracks of stanley anf the rest gloria all badly re issued on cd ...please dont waste your money as i did"
902.1.TERRIBLY BAD RECORDING I Love Gloria and thought this was an album featuring both artists together instead u get six tracks of staney then six of Gloria not together at all and all very badly re issued on cd please dont waste your money as I did
903.2."Polished but cheesy It's difficult to understand all the 5-star reviews this album has gotten. The production is excellent and the performances immaculate, but the music is cheesy and lacks soul. Honestly, the album screams ""sell out"", and it was sad to watch the great Wilson sisters come to this. Though it was a commercial success, and I'm glad for their good fortune because of it (being from Seattle, I have a soft spot for this great band), it is among the least of their albums. Only worth picking up for completists. Everyone else should stick to Heart's very strong earlier catalog."
904.3."Some Memorable Singles This release made a big impact for the Wilson Sisters and company. The four singles are all quite good and even some of the album tracks, Nobody Home, in particular are fairly ear catching. Will Heart be as memorable as the Beatles, Stones, Eagles, or Fleetwood Mac, I doubt it. However, they did make some noteworthy contributions to the world of rock n roll and a good portion of that is on this album."
905.4."They couldn't leave well enough alone. I'm not a rock snob; I just think Ann Wilson is sexy. I always liked this album; my favorite song is ""Nothin at All."" Until I got the CD, I listened to the cassette edition. I was disappointed to hear that at least two of the tracks, ""Never"" and my favorite, had been replaced with different takes. In the case of ""Never,"" I don't really care, since the replacement sounds essentially the same as the original. But the original track for ""Nothin at All"" is definitely preferable to its replacement. First, it's not as clean: Ann and Nancy add some extra vocal stuff that just gets in the way. Second, and worse, Ann sounds out of breath. One of the reasons I loved the song so much was because of the grateful confidence it exuded. That is diminished in the replacement track."
906.2."Heart Becomes a Hair Band To me this was the beginning of the end for the Wilson sisters. Sure, there are some okay songs on here, or so I thought until I recently replaced my vinyl LP with the CD. These songs sound so dated that I can't believe I used to like them. To put it mildly, this album was Heart's contribution to the 1980s ""hair band"" movement. Synthesizers and drum machines have taken over for Nancy and Howard's guitar playing. Dreamboat Anne and Little Queen still sound as good today as they did when they were released. This CD does not."
907.5."Awesome CD and great value! Couldn't ask for a better transaction. Shipped super fast and item was as described!"
908.5."The Best Heart Album Ever This is the best Heart album ever made in my opinion. I grew up listening to Heart and I still listen to them. I saw Ann and Nancy in concert last year they were awsome as usual. My favorite song is ""These Dreams"". Another good song is ""What About Love"". Heart has had numerous #1 hits and it's amazing people still love to listen to them."
909.4."Pure 80s At the time this was originally released, I worked in a retail store in a department adjoining the music section. They used to play these tracks all the time. After a while, I was kind of brainwashed. It got good to me, so I bought the tape.The tape always annoyed me, because it was so... linear. Couldn't skip the nasty tracks for the good ones easily. This CD release helps a lot with that. On the other hand, I only just bought the CD, and I stopped listening to the tape 10 years ago. It took me that long to remember to buy the CD version.My favorite tracks for ""These Dreams"", ""What About Love"", and ""Never"". This CD is about as pure 1980s rock as anything I can think of. Buy it if that's what you're looking for."
910.2."Low class effort by High Class Band This material represents why the 80's died, the music is bland and poppy, the Wilson sister's garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten."
911.5."Heavy synth, hairspray and Heart One of my favorite things from the 1980's was the synth-heavy pop-rock of Heart. Wow, how I love this album. Chock full of that classic 80's lite rock sound, with fantastic Ann and Nancy Wilson vocals. All around great stuff."
912.5."A Touchstone 80's Album There really isn't any reason I can rationalize it, but this is a landmark 80's album in the same mode the recording ""Boston"" is to 70's albums. It just sounds huge, a Phil Spectorish ""wall of sound"": Great melody combined with some grit tacked on to saccharine sweet hooks. This massive aural assault has bunches of decent, though big-time AOR, songs that help it, for the most part, hold up way past it's prime. Sure it sounds dated, but infectious, so if the mood is right, it still works. Unlike Boston's ""Boston"" (undeniably their best), it certainly isn't the best thing the Wilson sisters have ever done, however it stands on it's own as a unique sonic place in time which remains highly listenable. A guilty pleasure."
913.5."Good Memories If one word could describe ""the 80's"" it would have to be HEART. this cd brings back memories of when I was growing up and I would hear songs like ""These Dreams"" on the radio. Today when I that song it I con't get enough of it, I will never forget this song. If you love 80's music then I highly reccomend that you get this cd"
914.3."Corporate Heart Being a huge Heart fan since the release of ""Dreamboat Annie"" in 1976, I was not sure what to make of this 1985 self-titled album. While I was thrilled that the ""Heart"" album was such a huge success, I wondered what happend to my favorite band. They were no longer the folky, blusey, rockin band I grew up with - - now they were a huge hit machine with lots of pop/rock hits and huge hair. This album is, however, expertly executed. It accomplished its goal in spades - - turn Heart into a pop/rock hit making machine. All the songs here are good and Ann and Nancy and the band are in top form. Again proving they could play anything. However, the soul is gone."
915.3."HD ready I bought this TV a few years ago. When I hooked up this TV to cable the TV started turning itself off. The color wasn't as good as I'd hope nor was the picture."
916.2."SOPHMORIC I REALLY DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS BOOK AT ALL. I FOUND BOTH THE WRITING AND THE STORY LACKING AND UNIMAGINATIVE. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK WITH AN INTEREST IN FANTASY THAT REVOLVES AROUND ELVES OR FEY. I WAS SORELY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS BOOK. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER'S FEY HERITAGE. THE STORY ITSELF IS CHOPPY AND THE CHARACTERIZATION WEAK. A WASTE OF BOTH MONEY AND TIME. I WILL NOT BE READING ANY MORE OF THIS AUTHORS BOOKS."
917.5."Finished it in one sitting! Keep them coming! Bantum is an appealing hero and his adventures are exciting and entertaining as he fights for his freedom and his maiden. The middle ages come alive before your eyes."
918.2."poor durability, hard to find replacement parts I purchased this product 3 weeks ago. I purchased this because the ball is soft and doesn't hurt the little guys.I have 4 children that LOVE the game however after use the ball started to rip. It is now ripped from the pole and I have been unable to locate a replacement."
919.3."okay for younger kids I bought and set up this tetherball system yesterday so I can't attest to its long term durability. As far as installation goes, the directions have an error in identifying parts so that made things a little confusing. However, it's something you can still figure out. You are supposed to pound the base into the ground; not an easy task but doable with some serious pounding from a small sledgehammer. The ball comes with a pump to fill it; a nice touch but ours wasn't getting the job done, even slowly. An electric air compressor did the trick. Once assembled, the pole has a considerable amount of wobble. When my kids take a good hard whack at the ball the pole just bounces around. But when adults play together the pole jerks around so much the base has loosened (making it all the more wobblier). I really like the big soft ball but the overall construction and design of the pole are serious faults to this toy."
920.5."this is the one! This is the Groove Holmes disc to get! The entire disc is loaded with great music; ""I Love Your Smile"" alone is worth the price, but there's much more. Get this; you'll be glad you did."
921.4."Elementary My Dear Watson I searched out this film because the writer and director more recently made Kolya, which is a great film. The Elementary School is only available on VHS and I've had to blow the dust off my player to watch it. But it was worth it to know that the humanity, good humor and intelligence of Kolya have a predecessor in The Elementary School.It's set in the aftermath of World War II, but before the Russians took over, in the troubled eastern Europe, in what became, for a time, Czecheslovakia (sp?). For people who don't mind movies in which nobody is murdered, there are no car chases and nothing blows up, movies, that is, for adults, you'll like this one."
922.3."Didn't like the toning segment I have three small children so I exercise at home. I enjoyed the aerobic segment. This part was fun and not too difficult. The toning segment was too easy and BORING! Although Franchesca is pretty, she appears uncoordinated and makes the video ""pretty"" cheesy! I do the first part, then turn it off."
923.4."Technically and Musically Progressive I have to say I'm as impressed with the packaging as I am with the music inside it. For roughly the price of a single CD you get both a CD and a DVD. The full hour and a half mix on DVD is in 5.1 surround, and there are visual cues on screen that show you which tracks are being mixed in and out, so you get a glimpse of Hawtin's editing processes. There are also two videos, a long excerpt from from one of Hawtin's shows, and an interview in which Hawtin discusses how he made the mix. Finally, a high quality MP3 (without DRM) of the entire release is included for mobile listening. I think this release really shows the way to avoid/discourage piracy--not by threatening and using onerous software protections, but by being generous and giving music fans a real value for their money."
924.2."An Album Minimalist in Genre AND Enjoyment As a fan of minimalist electronica, I had to check this album out. I much prefer this end of electronica's spectrum versus sets or albums containing tracks which solely attempt to squeeze in as many beats per minute possible.However it is much more difficult to make an entire set of minimalist electronica work. As planned, 28 tracks, one transitioning into the next so that there seems to be no beginning or end. Just one long 75 minute track. Sounds great, but the result is very unimpressive. Hawtin's track selection is just plain terrible, and is the predominant reason that this album is so poor.2.5/5 stars."
925.1."Poor Quality Products by Rooster LLC This cell phone holder is one of the poorest in quality I have ever seen. The Velcro or Hook and loop come un-sewn leaving your cell phone free to fall to the ground. I wouldn't recommend McGuire-Nicholas products to anyone. Their products are some of the poorest made products on the market."
926.5."A great family Christmas movie Christmas may be a time for joy and laughter, but Charlie Brown has the Blues. To get in the holiday spirit, he takes Lucy's advice and directs a Christmas play. And what's a Christmas play w/o a tree? Everyone makes fun of the short sparse ""nevergreen tree"" that he comes up with, until Christmas works it's true magic.This is a classic family holiday film. It has all the characters that we have known and loved our whole lives. This DVD also contains the ""It's Christmastime Again Charlie Brown"" story. It has English, Spanish, Japanese and Portuguese audio tracks. This is a great way to enjoy Christmas with the whole family or with friends."
927.5."The best Christmas movie, ever. When I was a freshman in college, I stopped typing my term paper (due the next day) so I could watch it on TV. The next year my roommate gave me the video for my birthday so I could watch it whenever I want. There are only three things that I need for the Christmas season: A Charlie Brown Christmas, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and the Muppets album with John Denver. And then, even though I am a college student and have to spend most of December studying for finals 600 miles from home, somehow everything seems right again."
928.5."Very Good Transfer to DVD Commenting on what a wonderful Christmas special this is would be superfluous: I would only be echoing the comments of all the reviews of the VHS edition. As for the DVD edition, it's a good transfer, clean, no artifacts, good sound. Skip the second feature, ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown."" It just doesn't compare. My only gripe about the DVD: they fixed the one moment in the original master that captured my attention and my heart. Every year, I watched for the moment when the Peanuts gang gathered around the newly decorated little tree and began singing ""Loo loo loo, loo loo loo loo loo"" to the tune of ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing."" As the camera pulls in on the left side of the group and pans right, Pig Pen's head disappears for one frame when they all take a breath. You can see Patty's orange dress suddenly appear where his head was. I was really sorry to see them fix that. I don't know why, but it makes the cartoon even more endearing to me."
929.5."It's Charlie Brown... It's the movie you grew up with plus a bunch of other stuff. I teach kids who had never seen it before, they like it."
930.5."Charlie Brown Christmas I bought this movie for myself because it is a classic Christmas movie. Also it came in Blu Ray was a factor."
931.3."Great TV, Fair DVD This DVD contains two Charlie Brown television specials, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" - which is wonderful, and ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"" - which is not. The DVD contains no other bonuses. But then again, it's inexpensive, and you get to own the hands-down best Christmas special ever."
932.4."Classic I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It is his favorite Christmas movie from his childhood. I can't wait to share this with our kids."
933.5."Wonderful This Charlie Brown movie is the best, most masterful work ever made by the late great artist. This movie is part of the Christmas tradition - no less than the apple cider, the carols, and the tree - and truely captures the sentiment of Christmas."
934.3."Great memories but disapointing graphics thought it would be better I purchased last Christmas Charlie Brown Chritsmas dvd, and thought to purchased this year the blu ray dvd to see the difference in the graphics/images. Well there is no difference at all. Since my blu ray dvd converts regular dvd movie to hd movie, the regular dvd is nearly same clarity as the blu ray dvd. I don't think they can make it better, however it is a big improvement on the color and images, that I can say. But I don't think it's worth to spend of the blu ray dvd thinking it might be better than the regular dvd."
935.3."5 stars for Paramount version; 1 star for Warner Bros version I write this assuming you already know the story A Charlie Brown Christmas. Be warned that the audio on the Warner Bros version is a half second ahead of the video. It is more noticeable on the sounds (tapping of the aluminum tree, tossing of the directors horn) than on the dialog. This seems to only apply to the Warner Bros DVD, and not the Blu Ray.I am not sure if I like the video on the Warner Bros either. It is a sharper image; but it also seems to be a negative quality.This is a Christmas special that people watch every year. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have purchased the Paramount version from http://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Brown-Christmas-Ann-Altieri/dp/B00004W5UM/ref=sr_1_3?s=dvd&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1291690784&sr;=1-3 .One more comment: The 'making of the Christmas special' is a nice feature that is included on the Warner Bros version."
936.5."Proof that good things are built to last When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - ""Sparky"" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season."
937.5."A Holiday Classic I love Snoopy. He is my favorite. And I love owning this classic and bringing it out every holiday season and watching it with family and friends. It never gets old. A timeless tradition!"
938.5."Christmas Tradition- Schultz was a genius! Like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this animated film has imprinted on the American psyche the meaning of the Christmas holiday season."
939.3."So so The Christmas show was a great blast to the past. The extra shows that were included left something to be desired. I wish they would just sell the twenty minute Christmas show for two or three bucks."
940.3."Extras a disappointment I purchased the streaming video version for $10. I only wanted Charlie Brown Christmas - 5 stars and worth the 10 bucks; it comes with two other shows - a 2nd version of Charlie Brown Christmas (3 stars) and something inane called ""Flash Beagle""... (0 stars). If you're going for the original Charlie Brown Christmas... you'll get that. You'll have to decide for yourself what you think of the other two items."
941.4."A Charlie Brown Christmas Always loved watching A Charlie Brown Christmas on TV during the holiday season, now I can watch it any time.The extra features included were great, one I had never seen before. Thoroughly enjoyable speaking as a Charlie Brown fan."
942.5."Amazon Fan There was more to this disc than I expected. It has several additions that were good to watch. The cartoon itself is a good reminder of what Christmas is all about. Great for the kids or grandkids, or even the Scrooge sitting on the sofa."
943.5."A Timeless Classic! This video has been around longer than me and has earned a place in my heart. It is a must have for every one who collects Peanuts' videos. Though it was done in 1965 it still holds true today. It is full of wit and charm and is fun and entertaining for all ages. It has become a Christmas tradition in our home to watch it every year!"
944.5."If you don't like this movie, you're just flat wrong!! Christmas is about more than santa and presents. It's more than just the biggest tree with the best decorations. It's about a babe in a manger, three wise men and eternal salvation. In an innocent way only Charles Shultz and the crew can do, Charlie Brown (And Linus, et al) deliver this message loud and clear. I say everyone needs to buy this DVD before everything related to God and Jesus and the true meaning of Christmas is removed from the world... It's sad when a cartoon such as this may very well be one of the last strongholds Christians have on our own identity.My own personal soapbox aside, this movie is great. It's timely, even today. It's meaningful and it's truth personified. It teaches about the things that really matter in life, not the superficial garbage most people tend to worry about during the holidays.God Bless Charlie Brown!"
945.4."A Christmas Original from Charlie Brown My grandchildren and I enjoyed the gentle reminders in this classic movie of what Christmas is really about! Since the broadcasters frequently preempt this traditional Christmas program with political or other events, we are very glad to have our own copy now. Merry Christmas at all!"
946.4."Love the Music The score by Vince Guaraldi is one of my favorites and the story is sweet as well. There's a second bonus episode included tht I hadn't expected."
947.4."Great family movie. This is my favorite Christmas cartoon. It's funny, cute and I LOVE the music. The one downfall is that my daughter likes to used words like stupid and blockhead after watching it."
948.1."""Digital Copy"" not compatible with iPod or Macs (""Windows Media only"") Classic TV special, but the promise of a ""digital copy"" is misleading. On the back of the cardboard slipcover, in tiny print, is listed this limitation: ""Windows Media-compatible only."" It is implausible that a consumer would come across this disclaimer when making a purchase decision based in part on the overtly advertised inclusion of a ""digital copy,"" a term most consumers associate with the ability to view media on an iPod."
949.5."All time favorites I just bought the DVD to this great Christmas Special dated back to 1965. Who cannot love the Peanuts gang and Snoopy. Also, the DVD has It's Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown which is a bonus feature. Great family entertainment!! Too bad they don't make them like this anymore."
950.4."An absolute holiday classic! I still watch it in my forties! Only I watch it with my daughter now.Great Charles Schulz cartoon classicbrought to film. And biblically ac-curate too! Nice job, Mr. Schulz!"
951.2."Not worth an upgrade If you already have this on DVD, don't waste your money upgrading to blu. The picture quality is only slightly better, it's not widescreen and the biggest disappointment is that the sound is the same as on the DVD. I gave it 2 stars only because it's Charlie Brown (the show itself is worth more than 5 stars!), it's a shame they didn't take the time or spend a few dollars to make the disc worthy of the title."
952.1."Not a real Rammstein album. Bootleg collection of b-sides, remixes, and singles. Really, why even bother?"
953.1."An ""iffy"" purchase.. As the previous user stated, this is obviously a bootleg album. You can tell by the artwork (most notably the pixelated image on the front cover) as well as the mis-spelled songs on the back cover.I rarely ever purchase these sorts of CDs, but in this case I did only to have something in the car when I don't have my Ipod with me."
954.3."Nice pillow for the first month I really liked this pillow at first. It was comfortable and just the right size. After a month, however, the pillow has lost a lot of its personality and has become pretty flat. Most pillows will crush down after time, so I can't really say I'm all that disappointed. However, for the price, I was hoping it was constructed out of more sturdy material."
955.4."Too firm for me I bought this for a lot more money at the Relax The Back store. Amazon has a much better price. I like the design of it but it has some flaws. The pillow case is hard to get onto the pillow and stretches taught right where I'd like to rest my head making it a bit uncomfortable. Also the lower ""legs"" of the product are much too firm to have between my knees. It raises my leg up too high and hurts my hip. I'm 5'7"" so this isn't a problem of being too petite. A flat spot has formed within a few days where I have to lift it open to get in and out of bed. I still like it and haven't found anything comparable."
956.5."Love it! I originally purchased this for my pregnancy, as I was using 5+ pillows for support, and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con, because of its size, it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy, not at night when you're ready to go to bed."
957.5."Exactly What I Wanted I looked at all the different types of body/pregnancy pillows on Amazon and finally settled on this one. I am pregnant and have recently gotten to the point that I just cannot get comfortable in bed. I have had this pillow a week now and I absolutely love it. It was worth every penny. It's like sleeping in a nest, it supports me beautifully and its very comfortable."
958.3."good, could be better good concept, offers some support and comfort. i am 5 months pregnant and bought this pillow since i'm supposed to sleep on my side, however the u-shape is wider than it looks in the photos, and doesn't keep me on my side. also, the filling is uneven - firmer in some parts more than others."
959.2."Helps . . . With reservations This pillow is incredibly helpful for people who have difficulty getting comfortable in bed because it affords a variety of positions to relieve painful areas. But getting in bed can require some simple gymnastic maneuvers because the pillow is so thick and cumbersome. And getting out of bed also requires some special moves, especially if you have a high mattress. Overall, not a simple process for a good nights sleep. The head area also compresses after a few nights of use and rearranging the filling is bothersome. Because it's a considerable investment, I end up using it only occasionally."
960.3."Not a great pregnancy pillow This pillow is the equivalent of having two body pillows. Its not quite firm enough for use as a pregnancy pillow-the support for your back is just not there. I would recommend it for someone looking to replace a couple of pillows."
961.3."comfort U pillow for total body support I have chronic problems w/my low back and ordered this pillow so I could lay on my side and also receive support for my back. It is much tooooooo soft and does not provide the back support or between the leg support I need. Upon deciding to return it I learned that shipping would be $40 and the company would deduct 15%. I would lose about $50. I will keep it.Disapointed!!Lynnita"
962.4."Patricia Scanlan does it again! Another great read. You can really identify with the characters. Lots of ups and downs as in real life situations.I have read all of her books now and feel sad that I haven't another one to look forward to.I find she write in a nice easy manner and the connection between family members is so real. I would recommend this to any female looking for good story to curl up and read."
963.3."Nice book but.... The book is fine, very informative but it you buy the ""Witches Bible"" also written by the Farrars you can get ""The Witches Way"" and ""Eight Sabbats"" all in one book!"
964.4."tougher and cheaper than Apple's This is the best replacement power supply I've seen for a Powerbook or iBook. It's solid and you won't have to worry about the cords pulling out or the connector breaking like on the $70 Apple units. The only downside is that it's a bit less sleek and ergonomic than the Apple."
965.4."Don't even consider the Apple replacement This product is much better than the Apple OEM charger in terms of durability. It has a blue light on the adapter that lets you know if it's plugged in, but there is no indication that your computer is being charged like the OEM one. That being said I am very pleased with it and you could almost buy two of these units for the price that apple wants for their flawed version."
966.5."Great item! The adaptor works really well on my ibook or powerbook. It has a really long extension cord. The only problem is that it is slightly more bulky than the apple one. So, for traveling around, unless you have a big computer case, it will not fit nicely. Other than that, it is great. Much cheaper than a new apple adapter and works just as nicely. It is also sturdier than the apple adaptor and does not have the annoying light."
967.1."DO NOT BUY FOR G4 12"" POWERBOOK In a complaint to Macally regarding intermittent charging, their response was:Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4Thank you for contacting us.Our PS-AC4 has problem with the 12"" PowerBook G4. At this moment, we do not have any working one for your computer."
968.1."Not even a day... I bought this to replace the supposedly same power adapter that I purchased last year. This is NOT the same adapter as pictured for the item (I see that a customer has added two pictures of the true product). I was not concerned with this difference but would have preferred to have a light indicating the power is on. At first, it seemed to power my powerbook G4 fine, but later it started to cycle as charging and not charging, thus making the screen brighten and darken. When I shut the computer and let it charge, it did charge some, but I'm concerned about ruining my battery (which is also a replacement). It simply does not work when you are using the computer..and I'm ALWAYS using my computer! I will have to find an alternative to this product. I thought it was bad enough that the one I got last year quit working, but this is ridiculous."
969.4."works, at a fraction of others cost The wire connecting to my computer on my last macally charger just fried after 13 months (i'll take the blame i could have been wrapping it too tightly), anyways it worked well and costed a fraction of the original so I figured I'd buy again, so I've purchased another. This newer one is a different design, no longer has the light on the brick, and the wire that connects to the computer is no longer disconnect-able."
970.2."Not for iBook G4 Be careful. The box packing for this says it works with a PowerBook G4 or an iBook G3. It will not work for a iBook G4. The Amazon product page does not make that clear."
971.3."ibook ac adapter ok for the price but it doesn't leave the computer charged for more than 2 hours. The apple product leaves it charged for around 4. Otherwise a good product"
972.4."works ok for adapter I've just had bad luck with Mac adapters.. this one is wonderfully long cord, much longer than apples' adapter.. However, the place it plugs in is not always secure.. wiggles out, or doesn't connect unless i push it in from time to time. i like the snap"" of my daughters' new macbook magnet connection!"
973.4."Definitely Better Than The Mac One. After going through two of Apple's poorly made power cords for my 12"" PowerBook in a time span of three years, I knew it was time to get a third party power cord. The Macally power cord is simply awesome. It is is built sturdier than the Apple power cord, and best of all, it was less than half the price (Apple power cords cost you a hefty $80). The only minute problem I've noticed with this power cord is that from time to time (and it is not very often), my PowerBook will make a ""charging"" and ""uncharging"" noise. Usually I just have to fiddle with the part of the cord that plugs into the adapter, and it stops. Other than that, it's a fantastic purchase, and I recommend it to any one who is fed up with Apple's poorly made cords."
974.5."WHO NEEDS MAC ACCESSORIES Who needs Mac accessories when you can have an equally good (or better) product like Macally powerbook Ibook ac adapter? I purchased this item for my daughter when her Mac-made original AC adapter connection frayed and was not fixable. We tried to get a replacement at Mac retail stores and Mac on-line, but everyone was out of them and did not know when they would be available. This made me think that the original cords must have been somewhat defective since there was such a demand for them. We turned to Amazon to order the Macally AC adapter with some trepidation because the price was lower than the Mac-made product. That was several months ago and the Macally adapter has worked perfectly and we are very pleased with our purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a new adapter and because of the lower price, would advise it instead of the Mac."
975.4."macally powerbook adapter Good product. A lot cheaper than the apple version but does the exact same thing. Seems to be a little more durable as well."
976.3."Working now... but for how long? I've had this replacement adapter for nearly a month now with much hesitation at the beginning. Like many of the other reviews have stated, the power connection indicator at the top of my iBook G4 would alternate between power supply and battery supply, causing a very annoying flicker of the screen. That has since stopped and now when the adapter is plugged in, it charges as normal (i.e. allowing me to utilize my computer while it charges).When the initial flicker of the screen started at the beginning, the iBook would only charge if I put it in sleep mode and closed the screen. I'm not sure what I've done differently since the problem has stopped so I'm not sure where to give advice as far as recommending this product. Simply ""Buyer Beware""."
977.4."Consider this adapter First! I've been through two of the Apple adapters and they are terrible. This adapter works well with a G3 iBook. The laptop connecter is sturdier and other components appear to be adequate. A small blue led on the transformer indicates that the adapter is functional. I'm very pleased with this product which costs less than half the price of Apple's sexy but hopelessly flawed accessory."
978.4."Good replacement for old charger This is a good replacement for the Apple Charger. Only a couple of notes to make.1. The blue light doesn't indicate whether the notebook is charging or not, only if the cord is plugged into the outlet. This means that you can't really tell what is going on unless you open your laptop and make sure the indicator is showing that it is charging.2. If you drain your battery fully, so your laptop goes to sleep BE WARNED... You will not be able to plug it in and resume working right away. I had to plug it in and let it charge up for a good while before I could operate my Powerbook again, pulling power to operate the computer and charge the battery. This has been most annoying.Other than those weird gripes, it is a sufficient power adapter."
979.3."Not for 14"" dual USB iBook This unit is only 48W. The original Apple part (A1021) is 65W. The result is that a full charge for my iBook is 7Hrs rather than 3-4. Check the wattage of your original adapter. Watts = DC Volts * DC Amps. Otherwise quality is good."
980.1."Does not work with ibook G4 This product does not work with my ibook G4. As stated by some earlier reviews by other customers, the charger toggles between charging and not charging. Occasionally, if it is left on, it will continuously charge. I thought about keeping it, but it is unreliable and there are other third party options for $10 more.This one is going back to Amazon."
981.2."It stopped working after a few weeks It worked well for a few weeks, but then the battery of my iBook G4 stopped being re-charged."
982.4."alright in my book My Apple charger broke (big surprise), and I obviously needed to replace it. Not for 80 bucks, though. I ended up with the Macally adapter since I've had friends recommend their stuff in the past. While this charger lacks the whole hip Apple design thing, it more than makes up for it with function and solid construction. It's also nice and compact so it's easy to take on the go.My one quibble is that the main photo shows a white brick with gray cords and what appears to be an indicator light to show the charger is connected to an outlet. When I got mine, the cords were white (a plus), but there was no indicator light (a minus). In fact, that's how it appears in the user photos.The lack of that indicator light is the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 (I know, I'm picky). All in all, it's still a great product. It charges my 15"" Powerbook in 1-2 hours depending on my use, and it feels like it has a sturdy build."
983.4."Solid Replacement This is a solid, and affordable replacement for the apple AC Power Adapter. If you've got a late model iBook or PowerBook, you can't go wrong with this device. I've owned a number of Macally products, and while not as flashy as the genuine apple gear, their stuff always works flawlessly in my experience."
984.2."High Pitched Noise I read reviews of this product before I bought it that mentioned that it makes a high pitched sound. I figured these reviewers probably had defective adapters. However, mine also makes a high pitched sound. It doesn't do it all the time, but I worry that as it gets older, the sound will get worse. Although it charges my computer fine, if I could do it over again, I might pay the extra money and get a different brand...unless you don't mind high pitched noises."
985.4."Good for awhile I am about to buy my 3rd one of these. Each one has lasted about 6-9 months, while an apple charger lasts about 8-12 for the amount of use I put into it. So for my money, I like to buy one of these every 6 months for $30, rather then drop $80 on the apple brand."
986.1."Bad Product: Cycling on and OFF Nice form factor etc...but bad function. Product appears to charge my Powerbook G4 12"" when it is off or asleep, but when working it cycles on and off and emits a faint buzzing sound from the brick. Try another product."
987.3."Fan problems anyone? Soon after I purchased and we bagan using the Macally Powerbook a/c adapter /charger for my wife's G3 iBook, the cooling fan started running at warp speed. The fan would turn off when the cover was closed. We have switch back to the old ""mac"" charger and the fan is still very loud! I e-mailed Macally and they suggested that we had a defective charger and to return it to the dealer."
988.1."research before you buy This adaptor does not work with the dual USB iBook. It looks like a good product, but the plug doesn't fit."
989.4."Good product... I got tired of packing and unpacking the charger for my PowerBook everyday, at home and work. This adapter is a great option. It works fine and is a much better buy."
990.4."good cheap alternative The only downside to this adapter vs. apple's is the lack of the light ring which tells you whether the computer is fully charged or not. Otherwise it's a great deal!"
991.3."No instant juice For some reason if my powerbook completely runs down, attaching the power cord does not allow me to immediately turn back on the computer, unlike the apple cord. Do not know why this is, but this 3 - 5 minute lag time between plugging and ""playing"" is a real pain. Other than that, the cord seems to work fine."
992.1."NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IBOOK G4 I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY."
993.3."Does What It Supposed To Do You can read all the other reviews; I found them very helpful. I use this on my 12"" Aluminum PowerBook G4, 1.5GHz, 1.25 mb RAM. My only comment has to do with the difference in wattage between the Apple 65W rating and this charger's 45W. The lower wattage results in a longer battery charge time. Plus, if you operate the laptop when the battery is dead (plugged in, of course), the computer continually searches for the best power source, switching back and forth between battery and plug-in. This causes the screen to flicker between high and low brightness. When this happens, I let the battery get fully charged before using the laptop."
994.1."note to self: read reviews before buying I'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook (my dad says I'm rough on equipment). Let me tell you, the Macally is NOT it. Like others, it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises. After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger, I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap. It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode, but that's not going to cut it. If you have a Powerbook G4, don't waste your money on this."
995.2."works when ur Powerbook G4 is turned off this charger does not have enough power to charge my Powerbook G4 while it is running. it will show the charger indicator back and forth from battery power to charging.But when I charge while it is off, it works perfect.I had requested a replacement once and the result was still the same."
996.1."Defective product, bad service I purchased this adapter to replace another PS-AC4 that worked for about 18 months before going belly up. This one lasted two weeks. I called MacAlly and quickly got an RMA number, then I overnighted the defective item to them. That was ten days ago, and I'm still waiting for the replacement to arrive."
997.4."Adapter For The People After my Apple adapter finally went to the big orchard in the sky, I was overwhelmed with grief coupled with the desire to not pay full price for its replacement. A quick trip to Amazon and some button mashing led me to an old ally (pun intended) Macally and the PS-AC4. Click. Purchase. Consumer joy. I would recommend this. True, it's not as aesthetically pleasing as Apple's OEM juicer, but hey, what is?"
998.4."Amazon did not send a Macally adapter... Please be sure when you order this product from Amazon that you are sent a Macally charger... I had initially ordered one, but there was a problem with the address they mailed it to, so they sent a second one. I ended up getting both... Both of them turned out to be Macally knock offs and wouldn't plug properly into my computer. Thankfully, I had ordered a second one from Maczone for our other computer and I was able to see that mine was different from that one. I double checked the receipt and packing form to make sure I hadn't made a mistake, and it had my product listed as the Macally PS-AC4 AC adapter. I hope that Amazon will fix this screw up...The Macally AC Power adapter gets 4 starsThe Cheap knock off that doesn 't fit gets Zero stars..."
999.1."Faulty Product - Horrible Support I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization."
1000.4."Like the price, but connection isn't secure enough Was an affordable alternative to Apple's and generally works well, but the connector to the computer isn't secure. I'll be typing along and get a battery warning and have to jiggle the cord to recharge. Still, came at a better price than Apple's and I got what I paid for."
1001.4."Great Deal! so much more inexpensive than the apple adapter. takes a little longer to get to 100% but not significantly longer. easier to plug in anywhere vs. the apple adapter. significant differences in design and there is nothing on the adapter to indicate if its charging or if charging is complete.otherwise great buy!"
1002.4."Thank God! I love Macs and have had them for years, but I get really irritated having to replace the low-grade peripherals all the time, especially power supplies. The Macally version is great. Smaller, lighter and longer than the Apple version, and half the cost. Works just fine. I've used macally stuff before and it's always very solid and well thought out, definitely fills a void."
1003.2."Shock Treatment An AC/DC power converter is a very basic item, so I had little doubt that this sub for the expensive Apple original would be effective, though not stylish. Unfortunately, we have had problems. The Powerbook started delivering electrical shocks and inconsistent charging with this adapter, and they got worse when we moved to a country on 240V. I know that the shock problem comes from the Macally adapter because I have another PB and an original Apple power supply, so can do all combinatorial tests. I like Macally and have several of their other products. I probably just got a bum unit but unfortunately cannot deliver a positive review based on previous experience with the company."
1004.2."Good for a few months The adapter worked fine for my power book g4 for a few months and then it broke. Nothing physically happened to the adapter for it to break, but suddenly it just wouldn't charge any more. What's interesting is that the blue light on the brick goes on when plugged in to a power source, but if I plug the cable that attaches the computer to the brick in, the light goes out and it doesn't charge."
1005.1."Bate and Switch We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482. This adapter is differnet in the following ways..instead of the 10'cord with a velcro wrapper, it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer. This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board..this is not repairable. Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on. It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that. I am mad! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock. Months of emails, calls and waiting on hold...for a grain of satisfaction. It is insulting to think that these big companies have so little respect for us!"
1006.3."Cheaply made charger get the job done, but for how long... I wouldn't suggest this charger unless you are selling your laptop to someone and just need it to prove the computer works. The quality of construction, most notably where the cord that connect to the computer attaches to the power brick, is awful. Spend a little more and get something better if you can."
1007.2."Doesn't hold up to my backpack I bought this adapter almost two years ago and it still works-kind of. The insulation on the area of the cable where it enters the brick has become damaged, exposing the outer wire. I taped it up, but there is always a connection issue, where the AC indicator at the top of the screen will often flash to battery power and then back to AC. I keep the AC adaptor in the front compartment of my backpack, so it sees some but not major abuse. I'm sure this won't be an issue if you aren't traveling with it, but I just thought I would relate my experience."
1008.5."Exactly what I wanted I was worried when I ordered this because there were so many bad reviews. After all, it's a power cord there is only one thing that can go wrong how can they all be so bad. I have had it for about a month now and it's a power cord. yay!"
1009.2."Cheap quality and non-existant service After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook. After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether. On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect. MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I'd say avoid if you can."
1010.5."Very Good I read many positive reviews before buying this product, so my thanks to all of the previous posters. This adaptor is actually really great. I was a little upset before because I thought I was replacing my old G3 adapter with an even uglier one but was very happy to see that it isn't like the picture. It's the same shape but the chords everything is white, so it matches well with my ibook. It also has a pretty blue light that shines when the AC is connected, but it doesn't do much else. So if your worried about having an ugly adapter don't be because this is actually pretty nice. (at least much nicer than the G3 model adaper)"
1011.1."They are selling defective merchandise -- look at recent reviews! I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. The computer doesn't end up charging.In addition, the version I have doesn't look like the picture on the Amazon web site, and doesn't have the power LED.Clearly there is an epidemic of defective chargers. And we, the customer, have to go to the hassle of obtaining a return authorization and sending it back.I notified the seller. I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic, and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue. Other than this charger, my experience with Amazon has been exemplary.I strongly suggest that if you too have bought one of these chargers and have had trouble with it, please post here."
1012.1."Poorly made product The Macally PS-AC4 Power Adapter would not charge my PowerBook. I tested it with a multimeter, and found that it had an open lead.I contacted Amazon (even better, through their web site - no waiting on the phone or waiting for an email), and they shipped another.This second one had the same problem as the first.I contacted Amazon again for a refund.The product was junk, but the service was excellent!"
1013.2."Mishap Unfortunately I shall not be able to review the Macally Power Adapter. I did not pay due attention to the fact that the AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only.I plugged it in with a G4 iBook , it made some complaining noises and it died. Maybe it would be proper to really WARN that it will NOT work with a G4 iBook in CAPITAL LETTERS.$40.- down the drain!"
1014.2."Off and on Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion."
1015.4."cheaper and it gets the job done I wouldn't get this for a newer machine, but decent for an old beater laptop. Main complaint is that the powercord doesn't detach from the adapter (though a previous reviewer said it came as three parts) as I like to leave the powercord plugged. Though Apple no longer sells the yoyo, the cordwrap feature on the OEM was a nice feature. Unlike the picture my Macally has white cords, not gray, which is more aesthetically pleasing."
1016.5."Great Solution! This Adapter will do the job as good or even better than the original adapter for a fraction of the price. Unless you are deeply in love with the ""cute looks"" and the Apple logo on the original adapter save your self some money by buying this one."
1017.2."you'll be sorrry! After 4.5 months, the adapter died. I contacted Macally about the one year warranty and learned :1. the only way they will issue a refund is if the adapter causes a fire!2. I needed to send the adapter to the manufacturer in California for them to evaluate--I would be without a power cord for a week. They said the replacement adapter might be refurbished.Ultimately, I went to the Apple store and purchased a Mac power cord."
1018.1."Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""brick"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better."
1019.1."Macally Power cord Macally is a terrible company. NOT worth the money you save. I recently bought a power cord thru them that emits an electrical current thru my computer. They will only send me a replacement but won't give me my money back. Not worth the risk. Buy Mac!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4"
1020.2."When it worked it was great I had this charger for over two years. Last week while it was plugged into my computer, it just died. No blue light no current. I ended up splicing the connector to my old frayed Apple charger. The connector is much better than Apple's."
1021.4."Better than Mac's charger Like some other reviewers, the product I received did not look exactly like the one pictured. That's irritating. But, it functions perfectly, which is more than I can say for the expensive Mac chargers.Mac stores will tell you it's a ""myth"" that their chargers break. Um... why is it then that me, my brother, three friends and several acquaintances have had this problem?"
1022.3."A good replacement, but... I've had no problems with this charger so far. I purchased it as a replacement to the Apple charger, which stopped working due to the cord being so bent that it shorted out. My only complaint with the Macally charger, is that it takes much longer to bring the computer to a full charge than the Apple charger does."
1023.1."Works great... for about a month Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two."
1024.2."Power connector is not durable Adapter worked flawlessly for six months, then became intermittent. Seems to be broken or shorted somewhere near the connector to the computer. Even the ridiculously flimsy cord from Apple lasted longer than six months, so I can't say I'm pleased. Macally says they'll sell the connector cable separately for $17.00 which is not much of a bargain."
1025.1."Terrible product. Broke twice. Don't buy!!! Don't buy!!! This charger does not work. It broke twice before Amazon told me they would not send me another. The customer service was excellent from Amazon."
1026.5."Great replacement. We have 3 PowerBooks in the house, and 2 of them are using these cords now when their OEM powercords fizzled out - as the apple cords are known to do. While they don't light up, they do their intended job, and they do so without overheating QUITE as bad as the original cord. It still gets warm, so give it some space, but overall, a very nice product."
1027.2."Be wary of this charger I was hoping for a cheaper replacement, but what I got was a charger that was not much more reliable than my previous Apple charger.The problem with this connector is that it doesn't always seem to make a good connection with the computer. When this happens, it sends the computer into a powered-charging-battery loop. I have to fiddle with the connector to get it in just the right spot to keep a good connection. While this is only an annoyance to me, I wonder what it's doing to the internals of my computer."
1028.4."Top Notch Product The Macally PS-AC4 is a great replacement item for the OEM power unit. A bit larger than the original, it provides an easy velcro strap that easily contains the wires or releases them to do their duty. Easy to use with a better strain relief than that of the OEM. The loss of the tell-tale light at the base of the adapter plus is missed, but hte positives out weight this little omission."
1029.4."Does the job This is a solid replacement for Apple's charger. It is light weight and does the job it was intended to do. Blue ""on"" light simply tells you it's plugged in, but there's no indicator to tell you when the computer is fully charged. Lacks the portability elegance of the Apple charger, but costs a lot less."
1030.5."Exactly what I hoped for My husband and I both have Mac laptops and the dog chewed his charger to pieces (yay!) and after five years of use, my charger literally started smokig while it was plugged in (yay!)I went to the Mac company store to buy new chargers, but at a whopping 79.99 I only bought one. I found the MacAlly charger on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try. When we got it and tried it out I immediately returned the Mac brand charger for a refund. I love the MacAlly charger! Its actually long enough to be practical. It doesn't fall out of the wall socket from its own weight (imagine that.) And it never gets hot enough to fry eggs.BUY IT! It's less than half the cost of the brand name, it's a more practical design, and it's still small enough to fit into my little laptop bag. Sure, its not as novel or cute, and it doesn't have the little Apple insignia on it, but I'm not paying eighty bucks for one charger when I could buy the two that I needed for about the same."
1031.3."It works, but charges rreeeeaaall sssloowwww... The price is nice, but charging time is twice as long.I'm using this on a 17"" G4 Powerbook.For example:-when your battery runs out and the computer shuts down, with the stock battery it's about a 3 second wait (once you connect the plug) and you can turn your computer on.-with this charger, it takes about a minute before the computer gets enough of a charge to get things going again.-then it takes twice as long to get to full charge.It's still a good buy compared to the price of an Apple brand charger, but there is a pay off..."
1032.4."Does the job, price is right Considering it costs less than half the price of the original Apple adapter, it's a wonderful piece of equipment. it's great it is white as the iBook, and the cable that goes to the laptop is stronger than the original one. Just two thing to have in mind: it isn't able to charge a completely drained battery and run heavy apps at the same time; the other thing is that I miss the green and ambar light in the original connector!"
1033.5."Don't scrounge for the second-gen Apple adapter! This is your ticket! I don't know how long I searched and searched for a replacement for myPowerbook G4 power adapter replacement. I looked at Computer City,Apple Stores, apple.com, and even Ebay. The old adapters aren't availablein either of the two stores and online the adapters can hit you up for 80bucks! Ugh!This adapter works great with the generation of apple laptops before theMagSafe adapters and it's much less prone to malfunction and designflaws that will enable it to rip, etc. Very elegant, too."
1034.5."FABULOUS! Recommend it over the genuine Mac alternative. Couldn't be more satisfied with this product! And the low price ...I've bought my last $80 Mac adapter. They can fook right orf !!!:-)"
1035.4."very nice power adapter not bad for the price. the little box part of it gets really hot though. in my opinion it charges the computer faster than the power cord that came with the computer."
1036.2."Charging problems I bought this product to replace the original battery charger that came with my 12"" Powerbook G4. Unfortunately, it seems that it only will add charge when I have the computer closed or off. If I have the computer open while the charger is plugged in, it not only doesn't add charge, it also makes the screen brightness oscillate.I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone who needs to charge their Powerbook while using their Powerbook. Wish I would've just spent the extra money on the Apple charger."
1037.2."If you're tempted to throw away $30.... I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14""). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery, so I don't think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead."
1038.3."Only lasted 8 months My old adapter died a while ago, and since this appears to be the only charger still made that works for my iBook G4, I had no choice but to buy it. It has only been 8 months since I bought it, but the plastic coating on the wire near the block has broken open, leaving the wire bare. (And no, I don't wrap the cord tightly or anything-- when transporting it, I just fold it loosely. The plastic has to have been pretty fragile for it to break from so little stress.) It also makes an extremely high pitched noise when charging the laptop battery after it's been drained.It's still working for now, but I'm not comfortable having it plugged in when I'm not in the room, in case it decides to start a fire. Guess it's time to buy a new one... *sigh*"
1039.1."Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4 This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned."
1040.1."Stopped Working Day 3 Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear."
1041.1."sparked, then didn't work We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4. It went back the next day."
1042.1."Another defective one... This product would intermittently charge my computer, charging about half of the time and not charging the other half. It has 3 1/2 stars as an average from so many reviews because you get exactly what you pay for with this one - a cheap alternative.I was happy with the first one I bought. It lasted about a year and a half with heavy use. I thought I'd try another one but odds are you'll end up with a defective one of you buy a few of them."
1043.1."Disappointing and dangerous Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!"
1044.4."Nice low-cost option. Very pleased. Very pleased with this product that I bought as a replacement for a worn out Apple power cable. Apple has changed their plug system with the newest machines, but for anyone out there with a Pre-Intel Mac this is a great option at half the price of Apple's own product. Only gripe is that there is no power indicator light on the plug end, which is a feature on Apple's stock power cord."
1045.4."nice deal - while lacking the green/amber light on the end of the plug, it *does* have a bright blue LED on the brick itself. the LED doesn't change color according to what the powerbook is doing, it just indicates if the brick itself has power.- it produces 2 amps, rather than the 2.65 put out by apple's. this means that while it's ok for older ibooks and tibooks, for the new albooks it's slower to charge the battery if the machine is on, and for some machines like the newer 17"", may not be able to charge the battery unless the laptop's asleep.(this can be annoying at times, but for less than half the cost of apple's adapter and cheaper than most other 3rd party adapters, I think it's a fair deal)- the wire on the powerbook side twist-locks into the brick, so you can't yank it out accidentally.- no, the plug isn't grounded... but then again neither is apple's flip-out plug.overall, I think this is a pretty good deal, and might pick up another."
1046.3."The Long and the Short While the MacAlly powerbook ac adapter has it all over the original ac charger in terms of length (it's nice to get further away from the outlet to be sure), it's not altogether reliable as a charger. There are many times when I'll find, if I haven't been paying strict attention, that the cord has shifted slightly and, though it looks like it's still plugged in, it is no longer charging the computer. I've left it charging overnight to find in the morning that the battery is still not full. Makes me appreciate the charge indicator ring on the original cord that much more, too bad the Apple cords are A)given to dangerous wear & tear, and B)expensive to replace."
1047.3."Not too bad but... This book was a good read until the last chapters. The story line begins to unravel a bit toward the end. There are pieces left unfinished and the ending itself was so poor that I thought my copy must be missing the last chapter. Most of Binchy's novels are beautifully polished. Unfortunately, this one leaves the silver somewhat tarnished."
1048.2."A disappointment Maeve's forte is character development, dialogue, and interaction, and Silver Wedding was far below her usual standard."
1049.3."Not a Classic Binchy This book did not give the depth that Binchy usually has. It had a very week storyline and the reader did not get to truly know a character. I am a great Binchy fan, but was disappointed in this one. The story was too predictable."
1050.3."Review I read the book to the finish but found that her writing style was the same for each book I had read and the characters were boring by this time."
1051.4."Wonderful characterisation, as always I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy's writing. I love her detailed character observation and how it lets the reader recognise bits of people in her characters. Silver Wedding centres around a 25th wedding anniversary and the plethora of dilemmas such a seemingly straightforward celebration can cause. Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon. A good read."
1052.4.Silver Wedding Started off a bit slow but now I am hooked, not finished yet but cant wait for my next oppertunity to carry on with it
1053.4."Okay read I agree with some of the other reviewers that this was not her best novel. I would have rathered her write about only half the characters and go into more depth about those. I would get so into a story and then it would end, and the person wouldn't be heard of again until the anniversary celebration. I did like the part about the various invites to the party which had been answered, (Not a direct quote) - ""They would send flowers and a card,but would not attend, and that is the way it should be"" It was a quick read, though - great for a rainy weekend or a trip to the beach. Also try TARA ROAD - a good novel as well."
1054.3."Parts 1 and 2 GREAT! Part 3...Ehhh. I enjoyed the first two thirds of this book as much as any novel of the frontier I have ever read. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with part 3. The whole tone of the third segment was jarringly anachronistic and peppered with little in-jokes, for example, a Delaware indian is named Lenny LeNapier. The actual name of the Delaware tribe was Leni Lenape. I felt like I was suddenly reading a comic book with '90s people plunged into the 1840's. It seemed like Jones wrote the first two parts as a serious frontier story, then said ""To Hell with it!"" and turned the last portion into a farce. What a letdown, after the excellent beginning and middle, not to mention the author's superb The Buffalo Runners, where the authentic historical tone is maintained throughout."
1055.4."informative i have been doing the i ching for over 20 - 25 years and this book is veryinformative and it gives other ways of divining that is not in thewilhelm baynes classic. i highly recommend it."
1056.3."It's not the greatest The novel was engrossing and it caught and held my attention. But the book lacked a good heroine since Esther didn't actually do anything amazing. She was just a little adventurous and appealing to all Invaders."
1057.5."Mindcrime at the Moore Absolutely amazing. that's the only way to describe this DVD A must have for any Queensryche fans."
1058.3."Not what I expected Well I thought this would be a good addition to our concert dvd collection to listen to in our in home bar. While I love Queensryche, I have never seen them in concert and therefore was not aware their stage show is more like going to a play. I have gone to a lot of concerts and have not seen acting on stage. I guess some of you die hards like my husband expected it but it was distracting to me. It was hard to enjoy the beautiful, creative songs while watching such bad acting. And might I add that I felt as though ALL of the songs were lipsynched because the vocals were just too exact and sounded exactly the recorded versions. Bottom line, I would've rather played their cd's on my ipod than watch the heavy metal soap opera."
1059.4."Get this and Livecrime To really get the complete Mindcrime experience, I would recommend getting the Operation: Livecrime DVD as well. If you can find the one with the booklet, even better. Watch the first part on the Livecrime DVD and the 2nd part on this DVD. The original Mindcrime with the original lineup cannot be topped. For the most part, they did a great job considering they don't have the budget for live shows they had in the early 90's. Mindcrime 2 is not at the level of the first part. Who expects it to be?"
1060.1."Queensryche & Seattle Suck This performance is pure garbage. Unfortunately I was at this pathetic show. The audience was mostly old geezers who were there to watch a group of other geriatric has-beens. The sound was awful, their performance of West Side Story was ridiculous, and their hatred for America was sad. Halfway through the show, the singer was having serious trouble hauling his fat *ss around the stage. He sounded like an exhausted pig, gorging himself at the trough. It was bad enough that they would embarrass themselves by performing in front of people, but they actually recorded their disaster. Now they think they can sell this crap??"
1061.3."Stick to singing Geoff Well, lets start with general impressions. Overall this is a good DVD. The sound is great and the video is great. The band pulls off both Mindcrime discs very well live. It's true that Geoff Tates voice has had better days, but he sounds a lot better on this than he did on Live Evolution. However, his acting leaves much to be desired. I don't know why he decided to sport the Madonna microphone and act out parts of the show. He kind of reminded me of Meat Loaf in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But like I said, overall this is a great disc for Queensryche fans. I highly recommend it."
1062.1."Cheap corkscrew It's awful. I bought it because I wanted a red corkscrew. However, the description does not state how cheaply it is made. Each time I use it I'm afraid it's going to break when I turn it. It's plastic. DO NOT BUY!"
1063.3."Is it worth doing this for 90 days? Power 90 is one of the greatest workout DVDS. As a 15 year old, i would say that its a good way to get that body you want. ""Ab Ripper"" is one of the best exercises. ""Sculpt"" is a good exercise to get muscles in your arms and chest. ""Sweat"" is real dull. You can get the same results from kicking, punching, and dancing. But it still works out your calves effectivly.But one of the most annoying thing on this DVD is the commericals. Theres about 2 hours worth of ""so-called"" doctors pressuring to sell you vitamins that will help you get better results. As if i need more pressure... Also, is it worth doing the exercise every day for 90 days? But anyways, its a good DVD to get great results.(P.S. I think Tony Horton is obsessed with people sweating. You'll see what i mean if you buy this DVD.)"
1064.3."Good for beginners, but gets a little boring This is a simple workout that is good for those who've never worked out before (like my husband, who's doing it with me). I really like the strength exercises, but the sweat exercises (cardio) are simple and get really boring after a month. I like that the people on the video don't get a rest--they're doing the whole video just like the rest of us. We alternated sweat/abs 1-2 and sculpt 1-2 for the first 30 days. We're on day 44 and we're alternatiing the 1-2 and 3-4 sets now (gives us a little rest in between the more difficult ones, or if we just wake up too late to do the longer one). I'm ready to move on to something else, though. I don't know if I can do 46 more days of this..."
1065.4."Great to use BEFORE P90X If you are not in really good shape this is a great product to get ready for P90X. It does get kind of boring because you are doing the same workouts every other day, but they do work. It is only about 30 mins but it is amazing how well it works."
1066.1."does not work I purchased this product and the DVD's don't even work. I can't even use them. I get nothing,no picture,nothing."
1067.2."not worth it it surprisingly contained very little substance. just 1 half hour workout per disk. got boring fast too. i found better stuff free on the internet."
1068.5."It leaves you wondering... The Spanish version of Brian Weiss's book, ""Muchas vidas, muchos sabios"" is even more intriguing to me than my English version. (La version del libro de Brian Weiss es aun mas intrigante para me que la version en Ingles.) For those who believe in reincarnation, this is a great book (Para aquellos que creen en la reincarnacion, este es un gran libro.)"
1069.2."Very disappointing I ordered this new knife from Amazon based on the Laguiole name, prior Sabatier experience and the one review (5 stars). What a disappointment! One side of the blade had very visible tarnish and reddish blue spots (not sure whether rust or previously used). It also has a very light and extremely cheap look with poor manufacture. It is made in France, but it goes to show that junk comes out from there just as easy as from China, Pakistan or anywhere else. True you get what you pay for, but this one wouldn't be worth even 2 bucks at a yard sale. Maybe it was a defective unit, but I didn't want to take a chance with a replacement. I never even tried to use it, and simply returned it. To Amazon's credit, their return process was great. Just follow the online ""return"" process, print the (free/prepaid) return label, and take it to any USPS station. Amazon's service earned the second extra star."
1070.2."Not what I expected I bought this boombox for a kitchen that I knew needed to be loud. While the Hummer MusiXstation looks amazing and has pretty good functionality, the sound quality and volume is very low. To be honest, I wish it sounded like it looked. The radio is not very good at picking up FM stations, either. It does have a Audio in jack, which was very helpful and not available on a lot of other models.I was not impressed overall, and we switched back to our 1998 boombox in the kitchen.Pros: Looks amazing, seems durable, cool features (including audio in)Cons: Not very loud, sound quality is decent at best, subwoofer is a joke, digital FM radio not very receptive"
1071.1."Bad band The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. I returned all pairs I bought for a refund. Very disappointing for a Jobst product."
1072.1."Wouldn't stay up The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. I returned all pairs I bought for a refund. Very disappointing for a Jobst product."
1073.3."Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel Tidewater Charles Whedbee is a storyteller and this is reflected in his writing style. I found the style a bit abrupt and halting, but the most of the stories were interesting enough that I did not mind. ""Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel Tidewater"" tells the local tales of this North Carolina coastal area. The stories start as early as the first settlement, continue through until WWII and cover everything from Blackbeard and Hatteras Jack to the fate of Aaron Burr's only daughter.While I think I would much rather sit by a fire and listen to Mr. Whedbee tell his stories, I still think it was worth the time spent reading them. There are some wonderful little gems of North Carolina history hidden in these pages."
1074.4."excellent! Received my order promptly, as promised. No defects to the dvd, other than the content is very old, from the 70'si will enjoy this for years and my grandchildren will see this and make.their own decisions! I am glad to find a rare addition to my Bigfoot collection"
1075.4."Great Historical Fiction!!! This book was a great historical fiction!!! This book was about Colonel Knox and his journey to FT. Ticonderoga to get guns for general Washington. The story had lots of action and I would definitely recommend it to history lovers!!!!!"
1076.1."My thoughts on a terrible book This book is about colonel Knox a leader of a freshly starting revolution in America. His mission is to carry around 200 cannons from Ticonderoga back to a city where British forces are docked. The main characters of this book are will Knox 19 year old brother of the colonel, colonel Knox in charge of expedition, J.P. a farmers son .I disliked this book. It drags on and never seems to end. Just when you think your going to get a fight there isn't one .the biggest problem they had on the trip was a river with too thin ice. What's so interesting about that? If I were you I would not buy this book. It is extremely boring.From a reader of this book"
1077.4."A Fun Book to Stimulate Interest in History This is a fun book that should help your youngster develop an interest in American History. It is easy to read an has great illustratiions. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. Look for others by the same author."
1078.4."book appears to be a great book for my 5th grader who loves history. i am sure that he will be able to discuss with his class. Good purchase"
1079.2."Did not fit 2004 Kia Optima LX I purchased this for my 2004 Kia Optima LX. When I went to install it, everything seemed good. But the car was about an inch wider than the hitch and the hitch was not centered in the car. So either the hitch was off center or the car's mounts were. Otherwise seemed like a great hitch."
1080.4."Offers some interesting insights The author is seen by enthusiasts of socialist capitalism, also known as Rhineland capitalism, as a sort of guru. He preaches that a company is a living entity, whose main aim is to perpetuate itself, regardless of shareholder, or even stakeholder, interest.I have no use for this type of thinking. The interesting contribution he makes is the concept of the ""memory of the future"", which any organization can use to better prepare itself for whatever comes in the future."
1081.4."creative, interesting approach to Greece I like the mainstream of travel books, but I've never seen one designed quite this way. The author has woven a plain-language retelling of parts of Homer with descriptions of the modern Greeks as he came to know them. Fair play to the author: he has given us something refreshingly different.Lundgren writes clear, quality prose with above average descriptive talent. His deep affection for his subject is evident throughout, which warmed my heart as it deviates from the accepted journalistic principle (one I despise) of pretending to have no real human feelings. I tend to believe that a traveler learns more about a people when s/he tends to like them, and the author clearly does.Recommended for the travel reader willing to try a novel approach to the subject of culture study. For the travel reader with any interest at all in Homer, feel free to add a star."
1082.4."Greek Time Travel This was an interesting and engrossing book about Greece (including its surrounding islands) which helps connect the historical world of Ancient Greece with the scenery and people found there today. (Reading it with a map or atlas handy would definitely enhance the experience).The first half retells the story of Odysseus and his journey to Troy, with a special emphasis on the sites as we know them today (great for those preparing for a trip to Greece - especially if you're interested in getting a handle on the names and significance of the various islands). The second half emphasizes personal stories of the author's own travels and visits to Greece which bring to life its land, people, personality and culture of Greece.Fascinating and enjoyable!"
1083.5."Oh, so cool! Such a cool check book cover! Seems very durable and will last a long time. Very roomy, yet slim enough to fit in my little purse! Excellent price and very prompt shipping. A definate converstion piece."
1084.5."The most beautiful Cd I've ever bought. As a big fan of classical persian music and an Iranian I recommand this cd to anyone intersted in molavi's and nazeri's work.This very diffrent and amazing work by dastan and nazeri is for sure the best work i heard from them.I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I do."
1085.3."An open and open case If you are a fan of murder mysteries, then you must read Van Dine, who was a pivotal figure in the development of that genre. Unfortunately, if you are a longtime fan, this particular story will seem rather feeble. You will guess the general form of the solution very early on. But, it is of its time. When it was written, both the plot and the writing style would have been fresh and original. Now, it is a period piece. It gives fascinating insights into American 1920s society, and shows where the early Ellery Queen came from.Recommended for serious fans of the genre, but don't expect a 'never would have guessed it' moment.[PeterReeve]"
1086.4."A well liked gift I bought this for my father as a gift. He seems to really enjoy it. Being something he had in years past, the hand held infrared devices became a little hard to locate. While this one doesn't seem to have the super high build quality that ones did from years gone by, it does the job and as the gift receiver my father seems to be very satisfied with it."
1087.2."heat therapy I used this product a couple of times and was not really impressed. To get good results I guess you would have to use it in a specific area for a good length of time, otherwise not much good."
1088.1."Infrared MASSAGER Amazon responded immediately but forwarded to the supplier. Don't waste your money. It's a hand held wand that may or may not be infrared. Doesn't heat up to any degree that will be helpful. Still waiting to hear back from the supplier (two weeks now) to return this item. Know someone who has the EXACT same item and paid $10.... Enough said"
1089.5."Clear and Concise Introduction to Palmistry In my opinion, Richard Webster's Revealing Hands is quite simply the best introduction to the fascinating subject of palmistry. Students will find the material to be concise and easily comprehensible, unlike many other chirological texts. This fine book is a mandatory addition to the library of any aspiring or professional palmist."
1090.4."Best palmistry book and why...... I have many books on plamistry. Some have too much info to ever retain, some are way too basic. This one is just right for EVERYBODY. Here's why:* The history is brief (about 4-5 pages which is all you will ever need to know on the topic unless you are devoting to major study* The book tells you HOW to give a reading and a SCRIPT to follow. VERY FEW BOOKS DO THIS!!! This is worth it's weight in gold. I typed his script out and left blanks and when I give a reading I fill it in like a 'mad lib' but relevant to age and the palm.* Nothing vague about it. BIG pictures. Excellent area on fingers too.Richard Websters best material is not sold to lay people but this books seems to be the exception."
1091.5."..I Found This Excellent! Looking for a Palm Reading Bible you will go back to over all other pretty, colorful and modern New Age Palm Reading books? This is the one! Out of all the Palmistry books I go back to over and over when professional palm reading, this is the book I turn to. Why? Its black and white, diagrams give plenty of writing space for quick notes, writing style is down to earth and basic. For basic/intermediate study, this is a book based on old traditional rules.....Not a health study, more a realistic character study....I consider it the best I have in my Palmistry Library."
1092.2."Halica Bliss Out v.11... ...is the full and misleading name of this album, one that is as run of the mill as a fan of electronic metamusic could desire. This album has seven tracks, ranging in time from 3-11 minutes, but don't let that fool you into thinking there's much variety. All of them meld together after the first, ""Fish"", which is the highlight among few others that are moderately well-crafted and distinct. There is a definite feeling of sonic recycling (""didn't I just hear that whir on the previous track?"") and a limited sound spectrum within their grasp. One can't expect too terribly much from indie techno, so its unfair to condemn this album for lack of equipment. It's usually competent, even musical, but when an occasional vocal bit is all that differentiates one track from another, one tends to seek greener electropastures."
1093.5."Pure Funk This is just great music. Funk through the eyes of the great Eddie Palmieri. A total fusion of the time period. A mix of funky, jazzy latin rock-a little like the band ""War""."
1094.1."book only, no jacks I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1095.4."Cacho Excelente DC, aunque la grabación que fue en vivo y con un auditorio muy admirador de Cacho a veces entorpece el sonido."
1096.2."THIS COLLECTION IS INCOMPLETE THE STIFFS WERE A GOOD SOFT BAND.THIS CD IS SUPPOSED TO BE A COLLECTION OF THEIR BEST WORK. BUT MISSING IS HERE ARE THE SONGS 'D.C.RIP' AND ANOTHER GREAT TRACK FROM THAT 7"". FOR CAPTAIN OI!TO LEAVE OUT SUCH AWESOME WORK IS DISTURBING. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS RELEASE. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TITLED""THE STIFFS_LOVE SONGS COLLECTION"". THE BAND ITSELF RATES BETTER THAN 2 STARS, BUT NOT HAVING THE SONGS IT SHOULD OF HAD,GREATLY DEPRECIATES THIS CD."
1097.1."The Stench I just used this product for the first time and will be returning it.The cheap cologne smell is inescapable. Wash your face with this stuff and you'll be smelling it all day.I popped the top and smelled it at the store, but after using it the smell is much stronger."
1098.3."The Monkey's Paw I think that adults would appreciate this story a lot more then kids. I read it in my English class, and I wasn't scared or anything. I didn't especially like the story, and found it hard to understand. I think that if I was older that I would enjoy the story. I reccommend it for adults, but not for kids, like me."
1099.1."Monkeys Paw How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here later"
1100.1."Incomplete Edition The hard cover reprint edition offered by Amazon and others is incomplete. It contains Part 1 only. Note the page count (208) and compare it to the trade paperback versions (310-324 page count).Avoid this edition."
1101.2."Blurred Audio Audio is technically flawed. The instumental sounds are Not crisp and clear. The musical selections and the Ellington orchestration are excellent. But the unclear Audio makes listening to this album like viewing a blurred, out of focus photograph. Definitely NOT a worthwhile selection for serious Duke Ellington afficionados."
1102.5."Great extra pieces We always need these extra little pieces and couldn't find them anywhere. Great to find them here and good quality for the price!"
1103.5."Reunited with Reunion From the first tune, the chills came back. And when Glen rips into the words early on in Just This One Time, I was back to the old chair with the vinyl on the stereo. The tunes are a testament to Webb's remarkable writing and arranging talents. He puts himself up for all to see and speaks as if he has read my thoughts. Such a long lost treasure found again....thanks to the Aussies for put it all together! Now I must get back to listening...and smiling!"
1104.5."The Finest Material Available - Period I can't express my gratitude at the reviews I've read enough - I remember finding ""Reunion"" in the remainder bin at a Caldor's a couple of decades ago. I couldn't believe what I was listening to when I got it home. How could this album not be a top seller, I thought? ""Wishing Now"" is one of the most achingly joyous, if that's the best way to put it, songs of longing you'll ever hear. ""You Might As Well Smile"" is a masterpiece of soulful humanity. ""The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"" is pure poetry set to music. One of the GREAT albums of all time - period."
1105.4."Ol' Bearded-One does it again! I couldn't resist, I had to own this CD. Kenny's voice on these easy-listening standards was worth listening to. So I tried it, and was I ever taken aback. His rough, yet soothing voice unwrapped a new sound to these classics. It's hard to compare, because these are proven songs, but Kenny's effort deserves recognition."
1106.2.Definitely not a must have Nice pictures, but no descriptions and the map on the book doesn't even mention Merritt IslandBuy a proper birdbook rather than this overpriced pamphlet
1107.3."Almost there It was worth the price. The wood is nice enough. The dimensions are inaccurate, however: it is actually 14.5 inches deep - not 11.5 as featured. I purchased it because it was for a drawer that is only 12 inches deep. I am able to use it in another drawer, so all ends well. The construction method involved the use of staples that promptly popped out after a little stress - so I hammered in a couple of fine finishing nails to replace them and it works just fine."
1108.3."Does the Job The Loc-A Ball feature has no possibility of working. There is more than 3/32 of an inch clearance between the boxes. The balls probably stick out about 1/16. I screwed the boxes together so it works but not as designed. I was worried that I would split the wood so I stayed away from the ends and drilled and countersunk the holes for the screws. I used only one screw for each side so the box does not slide relative to it self. I would have liked to have used two screws each side but I decided to not take the chance of spliting the wood. I have since seen a similar box at a big box store which would have been a better value."
1109.3."it is a product of when it was written i think that this book has to be understood as, first and foremost, a women's studies title and also very much a product of when it was written. also of the times that the author is actually recounting, which was in the 60s/70s/80s. if you keep that context, then i think a lot of what it is criticized for is more understandable. it's dated. it could be deeper. and, yes, the author does come over as a bit self-focused. but it's not the worst account out there, either. worth borrowing from the library?"
1110.3."a mixed bag The insider/outsider view of Amish life is most interesting and, I thought, fair, in that there are aspects which she finds admirable and would like to bring into her own life and other aspects which, though interesting, she would not like to adopt. In most instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with Sue Bender's point of view, and appreciate the time and effort she took to become so acquainted with the Amish families and the message she offers. I knew Sue and Richard Bender when I was a student in Berkeley, visited their home a few times and found it and them to be most admirable, as artists and as people. I was inspired by the way they lived their lives. But I agree with numerous other reviewers that there is an annoying narcissism in the telling. Perhaps the inward-looking story of how she was changed as an artist should have been another book or been more fully declared on the jacket."
1111.1."There is no insight to be gained after finishing this book. It is absolutely unbelievable this woman IS a therapist, by reading her book, she NEEDS one. She relates to clay more than to children or people. Whatever she was looking for in an Amish community, she never found it and translates that to the reader. Don't waste your time with this very poor read."
1112.2."Author is WAY too self-absorbed I wanted to read this book because the simple life of the Amish people intrigued me.I wish this lady would have talked more about the Amish.Instead,all you read about is ""Me,me,me"".""What am I doing in my life?""Why do I do this/that?"" blah blah blah.By the end of the book the reader really doesn't care anymore!It was scarey for me to find out that this woman is a therapist-YIKES!The reason I gave it 2 stars is that (1) When she does talk about the Amish it is interesting (2) It is a short book and a quick read."
1113.1."Really horrible book This book is a self-centered piece of random musings. It is not about the Amish. It is about the author, and frankly, she's not someone I would really care to meet and discuss important issues with. She spends SO much time on HER thoughts, HER ideas, that one forgets this is supposed to be a book about the Amish way of life. This is not a journey TO the Amish. It is a boring, breathtakingly conceited journey into the author's confused mind. I suggest counseling for her. Her book just plain stinks."
1114.2."She did not get the point. I thought this book was a sad commentary on the lostness of the author. Though she sought to understand the Amish way of life, she totally missed what it is all about. Maybe it was because the church service was in German or maybe she was so focused on herself that she could not see beyond to the fact that peace comes from a relationship with God. Her final line in the book stated that miracles take a lot of work. I would beg to disagree and say that God is the one who does miracles and therefore they take no work, just faith. This is what Sue Bender missed and is still missing I am afraid. We use Amish textbooks in our home education program, so the insights she shared were not really new to me. I think her description of the Amish is valid, but her understanding is lacking. I would not particularly recommend this book."
1115.3."quick and interesting I enjoyed the author's plain and simple narrative and pictures in this book. Her story was well told using unadorned pictures and unembellished prose. It set a nice tone for her entire experience and for her struggles of letting herself just be who she is and accepting it. The only disturbing part of this book was that she left her family because of an ""inner voice"". What about listening to the voice of reason?"
1116.2."Disgrace of a book for anyone who studies the Amish writings 2 stars is pretty generous, in my opinion. This book seemed more like a book about the process she went through writing a book about visiting Amish families. I found myself wondering where I might be able to find the book she spent so much time ""pouring her soul into"". The book is largely spent talking about how incredible she is for having completed such a daunting task and is filled with many backhanded remarks regarding Amish communities. She comes off pompous and self-indulgent, not at all like the humbled, pious woman she paints herself out to be. Would recommend skipping this book."
1117.2."Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though ""O please get over yourself"". I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time."
1118.4."Disappointing, but revealing This was a nice book to read. It was pleasantly vivid, especially when talking about amish food habits (heaps of ice cream and all kinds of fattening food). I enjoyed the descriptions. the author's own disturbing and overwhelming need to express herself reasserts itself at the book's end, and as we move out of the sublime simplicity back to the mainstream American's need for selfish self-expression of every nitwit feeling and emotion and intuition I felt a bit nauseous. The book is a clear snapshot of a symptom of self-obsession which is perhaps most obvious in San Francisco, where this book is a best seller."
1119.1."PLEASE You sure must have missed a lot on your JOURNEY.The Amish are the most backwards group of misfits I have ever encountered.Where kids beat on when you were they? Were wives talked down to and belitted? Were animals beat and starved? I thought not. Maybe you should take another trip...and tell it like it really is. I do not think much of your book. It is NOT TRUE"
1120.5."Plain and Simple I felt this was an extremely well written and moving little book, and I have recommended it to many friends. In fact, I bought copies and sent them out. It made you stop and think about your own life and how we complicate and prioritize."
1121.4."Interesting, for what it is This is the story of how one woman became interested in the Amish and decided to try and live with them for awhile. It is interesting to read how an outsider would go about getting into this very secretive world. Her experiences are not representative of all Amish - as she says in the book, there are many variations of belief and practice among Amish all across the country. I was surprised to hear about Amish using a telephone, motorized pumps, polyester clothing, running shoes, and plastic, or using store-bought white bread and cereal that is laced with supplements.The author did not have this experience to become Amish and she returns to her normal life, but with some appreciation for simplicity in the modern world. For those who find resonance in such a concept, I recommend reading Barry Schwartz's THE PARADOX OF CHOICE: WHEN MORE IS LESS, for expanded development of that idea."
1122.2."The book presents history from a pro-arab stance. The book presents a historical and political account of the middle east from 1922-1984. The book was originally written in 1968, then revised in 1976 and 1985. During the process of revision, Khouri, appearantly, did not make many changes in the original text, a fact that leaves much of the book outdated. Khouri's account takes a strong anti Israeli and pro Arab stance. For example, he chooses to downplay the Palestinian terrorist attacks during the 1970s and mentions such attacks as the attack on the Israeli athletes in Munich and the attack of the Marine base in Beirut with no detail. His study is based very closely on UN records and ignores the reality of the Middle East."
1123.1."a real pain I bought this item 2 months ago because it was small and cheap. I use it daily. The grinding mechanism is already tired. Now it takes a lot of patience to actually get the desired amount of pepper/salt and it's getting on my nerves. So I'm browsing amazon for a real and efficient mill set.To be fair there is one thing I like in this product: the magnets that let you stick them to the cooker hood."
1124.1."Don't waste your mony Don't waste your money on these. They don't grind well at all. I just bought celtic sea salts and got rid of my table salt and was very disappointed as these just don't grind the salt or pepper. I have to go buy another set and hope they work."
1125.5.plastic globe pepper/salt grinders glass globes would be a welcome addition to thesewonderful little pepper and salt grinders, with 1 hand yet, the glass woul make it feel more professional, or legtitament if you will thnx bert
1126.1."really cute magnets but... horrible set of grinders. these handles broke before i had the chance to refill them! waste of money."
1127.2."Poor durability and hard to fill Never satisfied with traditional mills, I bought these because they had a unique design. I liked that they stick to the fridge but have found that means I occasionally have to wipe off pepper flakes. The small, rectangular holes make funneling refills difficult and messy. About a month into light use, the pepper mill gummed up and cleaning was a real chore. After about a year of moderate use, the pepper mill just wasn't grinding properly anymore. Cute but not very durable."
1128.1."waste of money hard to squeeze, hard to fill, hard to get more than a pinch of spice. there is a miniature hole to get salt and peppercorns in the units, they spill everywhere and don't hold much so you're always filling them. The handles are small and hard to hold. You have to squeeze them at least 30 times to get a decent amount of spice out."
1129.1."Cannot adjust for coarseness The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn't work. Disappointing."
1130.2."Not for the serious minded.. Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder."
1131.1."Broken in less than 1 month I purchased this pepper grinder at a kitchen outlet store. One of the ""rabbit ear"" handles snapped at the base after less than 1 month of use. I don't reccomend this product."
1132.2."cute but don't Looks like cute little bunnies on my fridge, but they're just eye candy. Shakers don't store a lot of salt or pepper. Handles are too small to comfortably hold, and it's hard to detect any salt and pepper coming out."
1133.1."review mni magnetic s& p set Neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well. It takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount. Perhaps the blades that crunch the S&P are not sharp enough? Very disappointed in product."
1134.2."Is cheap and thats it Is cheap and does its jobBut the handle feel cheap and seems like is about to break.Sometime the peper chop a big chunk off"
1135.4."Good Book........... A delightful change of pace as far as the main hero (Luciano) is concerned. Higgins does the WWII background well no matter what the story. (or plot) He manages to stick to his facts from other novel about the ""Mafia Connection"" and German forces. Though some of these facts are repetitive he manages to keep his readers on the edge with this change of pace (and hero)."
1136.3."Good authors abismal editors There are some good short stories in here that explore some interesting concepts. Others are poor and need some more work. All in all the fiction is good and worth getting but the editing is atrocious. This book is riddled with countless mistakes and misprints that should have been picked up by any half competent editor. None of them get in the way of the stories and it is always clear what the author meant. So the book is still worth buying unless little things like ""petal"" instead of ""pedal"" annoy you. In that case steer well clear of this book."
1137.2."This is high school creative writing... I was quite disappointed with this collection. After the first three stories, I basically gave up. Interesting concepts that could have benefited a great deal from a really good editor. This stuff really belongs in 12th grade creative writing class."
1138.2."Substitute the name ""Burmese"" for any cat Although books about particular cats/pets are rare and appreciated, I'm afraid this book gave me no further insight into my Burmese cat. Perhaps I am asking too much but I expected to find a plethora of special insights into this special breed. I didn't.Especially in modern cat care I felt this book lacking. My breeders says: Fresh meat three times a week; chicken wings (raw) at least twice for dental hygiene, vary the diet, enjoy the peculiarly dog like characteristics of the Burmese. But mabe that's all asking too much - gotta go, Nero is bringing his beloved yellow wash cloth for retrieval...It is hard to criticise a book that describes the best breed of cat on earth. Let's all write one!"
1139.2."Other than the History of the breed, not specific to a Burmese Cat at all! I must agree with the other reviewer that this book offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat... The history section is specific to the breed (but as a new or existing Burmese owner, you'd probably already know this prior to getting one!) & there is one blurb regarding the Burmese characteristic to yowl when they require attention. Beyond that this book could really be for any other cat out there (feed your cat, give it water, groom it,...). It didn't even specify normal size/weight ranges for the breed and what quantities of food to give them as a guideline. So, in my opinion, useless to a new Burmese owner. Also, I was a bit disappointed that all of the photos are only of Sable & Chocolate Burmese (they are all gorgeous, but a few photos of Blues or Lilacs would be appreciated). All in all this book was disappointing."
1140.4."Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat: Feeding, Grooming, Health, Handling, Exhibition This book is a great starters guide to owning and basic understanding of the history of Burmese cats. Useful basic information on care, feeding and breeding."
1141.4."Just as good... If you have to get this book for a class and you want a less expensive alternative to the latest edition, this may be your answer. I am using this in my class right now and so far the differences are minimal."
1142.5."Stellar, as usual BP remains the standard for baseball annuals, with zillions of player comments both informative and entertaining, and team comments which are generally excellent.They know more about more players than anyone else.Minor quibble: Every year the back cover exhalts BP's predictive prowess and gives examples, yet for some reason the 2001 edition fails to speak of, for instance, the success of the Minnesota Twins and Jeff Kubenka. But that's just marketing, I suppose -- it is a great book."
1143.5."The New Standard Bearer BP sets the standard, not just for baseball books but for all annuals of any genre. The depth and breadth of coverage seems to grow each year. Whether you're a fantasy player or a hard core fan, this book is indispensable."
1144.3."Good, but not great The stats and projections are all fantastic. However, I found the essays lacking and the book as a whole didn't live up to my lofty expectations. Next year, I will probably forgo buying the book and just stick with my subscription to the web-site."
1145.4."Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short."
1146.1."Bill James it ain't No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's."
1147.1."Not a fan Nothing here that you can't glean for yourself if you have a PC and know how to use Excel. Anyone can run numbers and models, and really that's all you get.The ""writing"" (purposeful quotes) is painful.Buying this book is no different than putting a match to your money."
1148.4."A Story of Old England For those unfamiliar with Churchill, do not dive into this book looking for a university reader in English history. Churchill is a masterful writer and storyteller, and he weaves a tale for over 500 pages of the rise of England - from the pre-Roman times to the rise of the Tudors. Covering nearly 2000 years in 500 pages is a tall order, but Churchill spends adequate time on the major stories of the period. The book reads more like a novel than a scholarly history and the characters can come alive. A nice background on early English history for the ""casual"" reader."
1149.4."I SPY for younger children Shipping was fast and packaging great. I was slightly disappointed that this seemed like an I Spy book for a much younger child than my 8 (almost 9 year old son)..... I wish I had known that ahead of time. Still, a great beginner I spy book, well put together and nice sturdy cover. Thank you."
1150.4."Good for my toddler It is perfect for my hyper toddler boy. He loves to spy items especially cars. I'll get more I spy books."
1151.4."Markham sheds light on 'Napoleon' In his book, 'Napoleon,' Felix Markham traces the rise and fall of one of the most important men in western history. As a biography, Markham sometimes relies too much questionable references, but as a history, 'Napoleon' ranks among the great works on the subject. The reports of the battles and the men who served the Emperor are first rate. One can almost imagine being at Marengo, Austerlitz or Waterloo, or riding alside Ney, Marmont, or Junot. Perhaps some of the most appealing aspects of this book are the accounts of Napoleon's life after his exile to St. Helena and the events surrounding his death. Markham also shows us how the Napoleonic legend helped to shape post-Imperial France. I would recomend this book to anyone who would like to know more about this facinating historical figure."
1152.2."A Military History This may be a good book on military history. I am not a military historian, so I cannot attest to how sound Markham's research into that subject is. Just know what you are buying. There is almost nothing here about Napoleon as a person, not compared to most other biographies. And the social context which gave rise to Napoleon is not really explored here. I find the first two chapters of the book that deal with Napoleon's genealogy and his early years interesting and well-written. After that the book got too dense and the writing style rather pedestrian. Everything beyond the first chapter of the book is written for a specialist (a scholar who focuses on the 19th century or on military history). At the time of the publication the book received such glowing reviews that I cannot help but wonder what I missed here."
1153.2."An Unclear Biography of Napoleon Napoleon is probably one of the most widely written about historical figures. There are many differing views about his intentions and ambitions. Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity. 'Unreliable' memoirs are those which were written by those, between 1815 and 1830, who wished to regain Bourbon favour and be allowed back into prestigious positions. I feel that Markham doesn't give a very lucid explaination for the intervention in Spain or for that matter in Russia. Towards the end the picture drawn in this book becomes more nebulous, and we are given the choice between two uncompromising pictures of Napoleon."
1154.3."It's ok. Nothing special. It dragged on and on. Out of respect I watched the whole thing. I was more about the willpower of an older lesbian."
1155.4."Orange Mound Representer Chopper Girl's debut album on HooDoo Labs is a throwback to an older often times forgotten subgenre of Memphis rap.The album has dark overtones and rides a fine line between Horrorcore and Gangsta Rap. Touching on a variety of subjects Chopper Girl seems to show she isn't a one trick pony and this album has selections ranging from a high octane posse cut to dark and sinister tracks that are heavily influenced by vodou and all the way back to selections that will easily get people moving in the clubs and c-walking on the streets. A veritable whose who of Memphis artists make guest appearances both vocally and on the production side of the house. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Memphis underground."
1156.4."Very good album This is definitely worth coppin. Got some bumpin tracks. It contains a variety of songs, she is NOT one of them artist where all tracks sound the same. 15 tracks, and at least 10 of them are worth bumpin all the time. She has a music video for ""Still Buck"" too. You can download it from her labels website. HoodooLabs.com"
1157.5."Worth it for the Furs cover alone. Okay, a lot of this has been released elsewhere and some might find the price tag unjustified. However, this is worth it if for no other reason than the weird postmodern refraction (or something like that) of Robyn covering fellow '80s college rock casualties of the great alternative sellout of the 1990s, The Psychedelic Furs. ""The Ghost in You"" gains something in his sparse folk arrangement that it didn't have in its synth heavy/Richard Butler's limited vocal range but still great original version.Get it before it goes out of print like every other Hitchcock release.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1158.4."Nice unofficial comp This is a bootleg and quite a number of the tracks have since been released as bonus tracks on the Rhino issues. But there's still a few choice nuggets that will delight the Hitchcock fan that one would be hard pressed to find anywhere else."
1159.3."Invisible History--Live ""The Ghost in You"" I got this just to get Robyn Hitchcock's live version of the Psychedlic Furs ""The Ghost in You."" A few other songs are worthwhile, but his version of TGIY is amazing."
1160.2."shallow and unmoving The book was badly observed and shallow, with predictable and cliched plots. It made me want to throw up mostofthe time, and offered very little insight into the characters feelings. Do not read it unless you have to."
1161.1."I could have spent my money better This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all."
1162.4."Excellent singles whichever ones you choose There are basically 3 singles out there to ownwhite cover UK single 1 (stellar is not actually acoustic like on the drive single)1. Are you in2. Are you in (oakenfold remix)3. Stellar (Acoustic)Are you in (video)red cover UK single 21. Are you in2. Wish you were here (live)pardon me (live video)australian release1. Are you in2. Are you in (oakenfold remix)3. Wish you were here (live)4. Warning (live)5. Stellar (live)Overall if you just want the tracks, get the aussie single, if you need the videos as well then get the 2 UK cds.as far as tracks go, all of them are very good, the live versions, especially warning are excellent quality. The remix of are you in is surprisingly awesome to the point you would think thats the way the song is meant to sound if hearing it the first time.Hope that is of help"
1163.3."Better Than I thought I purchased this book because my book club was reading it. It looked pretty lame at first. It turned out to have some useful information in it. It is a good resource item to have in your bookcase. I was originally going to take it to the used bookstore when the bookclub was done with it. I ended up keeping it for future reference."
1164.3."A Handy Text I wish that I had had a copy of THE URBAN PRIMITIVE before I moved into my new apartment. I would have used some of the cleansing and blessing rituals included here. This is a useful book for Pagans from a variety of traditions; many of the suggested rituals can be adapted for particular paths. The authors also offer very practical advice for urbanites on a budget, such as seeking out goods at thrift shops and junk yards (after invoking the Goddess Skor, of course). A good gift for someone moving away or moving into a new area."
1165.4."Urban Primitive Spiritualism This is long overdue. Most people get only so far along in the Modern Primitive scene without ""going native"". Here is a book that gives excellent and easily followed guidelines for anyone who wants more from their experiences as a Modern Primitve. Combining Piercings, Humor and Good Spirituality, this is a great buy."
1166.3."Good, but still some fluff around the edges So your interested in Wicca but live in a city not the country, then you want this. One suggestion though: skip over the chapters on deities and ghosts, that's where the majority of fluff is found.An enjoyable read, if you can read it to get the most out of it and not just take the face value."
1167.4."Satisfied Customer With the double vibes, this little dude has all the power you will ever need. The wife loves it! The only down side is the size. The ring is a little small, and not very flexible."
1168.1."broken I was not even able to use this item because it tore upon putting it together. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
1169.2."Didn't do much Maybe my husband is bigger than normal but we had the hardest time getting this on. Once it was on we wanted it off pretty quick. The vibrations weren't very strong and one of the vibes was stuck in the on position so we had to remove batteries to turn it off. I didn't get any benefit from it and I don't think he got much."
1170.4."Excellent writing! This book is a fabulous depiction of the Italian nun, Benedetta Carlini, whose drive for ambition in the Catholic church drove her to get the help of her lesbian lover to create the illusion of stigmata. Through this, she moves to new heights of power and respect in the church and brings money and fortune to the church...but upon accusations and scrutiny, she's brought down to pay for her ambition. The story is a tenderly told one. It has feminist elements and deals with the desperate desire of spoils, along with a not-so-pretty picture of the Church."
1171.3.colour change this eyeshadow is not the same colour as the one I bought in HollandThe first one is more mauve(purple and bluish)this new one is too purple{dissapointing) even though both are named Parfait amour
1172.5."Excellent travel book I ordered this book after visiting the Amazon and Dr. Smith's clinic. The descriptions of her work there and her clinic, local people and their community, culture, climate, plant and animal life were spot on so it was a joy to read and added depth to my travel experience. Dr. Smith's medical dedication and adjustment to life on the Amazon is inspirational."
1173.4."Trip to Amazon This is a well written book that engages the reader in life on the river and the problems and innovative solutions the author achieved.I visited her clinic and it is wonderful the care the people can receive."
1174.4."Amazon doctor tells all Linnea Smith's story captures you from the very beginning. Telling of her experiences as a physician in the Amazon jungle often keeps you on the edge of your seat. Taken directly from her journals, it discusses her experiences over a 7 year period of practicing medicine in the jungle without all the current medical technology. She also talks of the natives, their beliefs and some difficulties encountered because of the disparity of cultures. This book is an easy and enjoyable read."
1175.3."Great Product but Lacks Some Enhanced Function I bought this scanner mainly for its enhanced data functionality. However, after activating the GM Enhanced Data I found out that it was still not able to display some of the enhanced data such as CAM Retard, which is what I needed to set the distributor on by GM Vehicle. The standard features worked good, fast communication between scanner and vehicle, and you can clear codes without having to shut the engine down (cheaper scanners force you to have the engine off to reset the fault codes). If SPX can get all of the enhanced data working on this scanner I would give it a 5. My best word of advice before you buy, search forums and call SPX tech support to verify the data you need is available on the scanner."
1176.1."Not like I remember it I bought this book 'cause I loved the movie when I was a kid. The book is really dry and a little hard to relate to. It's very English with lots of Moor descriptions.Couldn't finish it. Want it?"
1177.2."Four Star Music - get the other edition though Capitol's 1990 reissue of The Beach Boys' 1960s LPs gave us 2 of these albums on 1 CD at normal price. They're back for who knows how long - so get them while they're hot. On the 2-fer version of ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" which is in STEREO by the way and not MONO as it is here, you also get ""All Summer Long"" plus you get a nice stack of bonus tracks. Don't pass up this warning - and get the 2-fer instead - quick!"
1178.1."Not what I was anticipating Thought it was a picture book of the Fiords.... That's what happens sometimes when you cannot actually touch a book..."
1179.5."Unique and Captivating China High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. Adds fun to the dining experience and cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher. Arrived in absolutely perfect condition and was packaged exceptionally well."
1180.4."nice print a bit small then i would like but it was nice. Got it for my son's History class and it worked out great"
1181.5."Wonderful book...from ex-Hoosier I grew up in Indianapolis and really enjoyed reading about all of the things that have gone away since I was a little kid. I used to love Burger Chef, and the downtown Ayres store. I remember the Riverside Amusement Park sitting closed there for years when we would pass it going out to the Speedway.The author also has a webpage called ""Lost Indiana"" which talks about some of the Lost Indy topics, but also some other neat sites in the rest of the state. You could google this to find it."
1182.4."Great for mp3 phones, not so loud. A great device, I use it with a NOKIA 9300 it is great.I use it during the gym, I can hear my songs and do not waste a call at all.Cons.: Low Volume, Not as loud as an ipod or mp3 playerPro: Very very confortable, great singal coverage.I you are looking for hearing your mp3 songs in your phone it is great. Watch out that it is not compatible to hear mp3 music from all MOtorola, I tried it with a V3i, and I only was able to use it as a regular bluetooth headset, I could not hear any music at all.I gurantee you your satisfaction."
1183.3."IT WONT PAIR WITH MY IPOD IN MY IPHONE IT PAIRED WTH MY IPHONE FINE AND IT WORKS REALLY WELL.BUT IT WILL NOT PAIR WITH THE IPOD IN MY IPHONE."
1184.5."It's my favorite CD!!!!!! Wow! This is my favorite CD right now. Warning, if you liked Natalise's first album this one is a little different. And it's 20 times better! The music is totally hot and there are some killer beats and really great slow songs too. Her voice is amazing. And the lyrics are really meaningful. If you listen to the lyrics you can tell that she is talking about true life experiences and not just singing the same things as other other artists. And ALL the lyrics are printed in the booklet. It's a really big booklet with LOTS of pages TONS of photos and all the lyrics for every single song! The booklet is like a bonus. There are so many good songs on this album, It's the best CD I've bought in a couple years.I give it 6 out of 5 stars"
1185.5."Guy Clark is the best Guy Clark continues to show what great country music really is. In these days of Shania Twain and the like where country is really a form of pop with cowboy hats, here comes Guy Clark with ""Cold Dog Soup"" that reminds you that great music with poetry in the likes of Hank Williams,Merle Haggard Willy Nelson and Townes Van Zandt still gets recorded. This is the true stuff that makes you think and tap your feet at the same time. This is an incredible production! Great work Guy! From Fort Worth Blues a Steve Earl Song to Red River, man you oughta be proud! This should be on the charts! But with the current country scene forget it.. Oh yeah what a great line "" Baby don't let um blow smoke up your dress...."" Also if you haven't written the song, you really know how to choose someone elses material and make it yours."
1186.5."Simply Wonderful Being a fan of progressive rock, at first listen I didn't think much of this album because it didn't sound like there was much there. Don't make the same mistake! Don't be fooled by this album's simple sounds. They belie a complexity of story and emotion - an honesty that permeates every note on this album and is beautifully woven into a harmony of voice and guitar. This is a great album that is also well recorded - nuff said!"
1187.2."A little too Lite Purchased these socks looking for the right balance of light construction and cushioning. I found only the light construction part. While they seem durable enough, the socks are way too light to provide an adequate barrier between my shoes and my feet. It's easy to earn a blister on anything more than a short run.These may be just right for someone who does not punish their feet with marathons and triathlons, but just not substantial enough for me."
1188.3.they are not good they are not up to the mark i can get them cheaper in china town with more quality any way its cheap
1189.4."What a useful collection. It's good to have all Paine's material in one handy volume. Plenty to read and think about. It's a pity he's not better known in the USA, considering his significance in the existence of the country."
1190.5."I feel like punching the Queen evertime I read his works Brilianty written with passion and fury for the common men of this historic period of time. Essays written not for the elitests but for those who could and did make a difference. Paines works are truly historical and express the point of view of the common man who day after day is raped with taxes and control by a royal family thousands of miles away who could care less for the people they take claim to.His works helped give birth to the greatest nation to bless the Earth."
1191.5."A Man of True Feelings For His Country. Not his Government. Paine was a patriot that believed that the country belonged to it's people, and it was up to the citizens to keep their democracy.He like the other founders knew that in order to be a truly free people they must rebel against th tyranny of England and set up a democracy where the people ruled it's government.A revoluntary, patriot whose readings is a must for anyone that is for keeping the government, of, by and for the people."
1192.5."A Man of Reason At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea ""Individual Rights"" down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that ""we have it in our power to make the world over again"", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing ""We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way"". Let's work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!"
1193.2."Does he even have an editor? I have no background in history and do not pretend to know what I'm talking about in that regard. However, when it comes to grammar, I know what I'm doing - and Howard Zinn, apparently, does not. The chapter of this book that I was given (Chapter 8: On Presidential Liars) was the most horrendously written piece of work I've ever read. Please make note of the fact that I read high school essays frequently; I thought I'd seen it all. Apparently, I was mistaken. According to Mr. Zinn, the American people have been ""deceived about"" much more than we thought, and should all ""deep anguish"" over it."

1195.2."Taylor Made Gazebo When trying to install the products attachment brackets to the boat railing three of the eight screws supplied sheared off. When attempting to attach the cover over the frame, I discovered one of the velcro pieces sewn into the cover was coming unraveled. The center support pole that installs across the top and runs from front to back is supposed to have a pocket for the pole to fit into sewn into the cover at each end; mine only had one pocket making the center support useless. Got in touch with Taylor Made customer service to resolve the issue. They arranged for pick up of the defective product and said a new one would be sent right out to replace it....... over three weeks later and I still haven't received it.

1197.2."Not his best effort Max must have had a dictionary by his side while writing this bunch of hog wash. I read to be drawn into a story and it did not happen."
1198.4."The Night Horeseman This book is written with a Victorian flair that may have been Max Brand's style. As this is the first work I've read from him (even at my age) I can't be sure. It was intriguing and written for the era. Brand was a popular writer of the time and has a strong command of the English language, which he uses to fully illustrate his characters. His descriptors however do tend to be lengthy and at times drag on for too long. Overall, a good read."
1199.3."A different max The book was long and drown out but a book to read as are most of 'macs books. A read for all."

1205.5."One of their best yes, but definitely their most unique. This is for sure many peoples favorite release from the band, and rightfully so, as it definitely is their most unique record in the catalog in my opinion. Epic and huge sounding, this is a classic album. Everything from killer cover art, to the lyrics... it actually transports you to the place you see on the cover of the album and makes you wonder; who is living in that cold and grim little ice castle that is sitting just on top of hell... or maybe that's just what icechests look like in Norway and they are camping and their campfire needs another log... Either way, this would be the album I would give to someone who has never heard or heard of the mighty IMMORTAL. Metalhead or not, You've never heard anything like this. IMMORTAL RULES!!!"
1206.5."Not just for black metal fans This is a great cd by Immortal, even though I'm not a huge black metal fan. A+.My favorite song on this cd is Withstand The Fall Of Time."
1207.5."A new fan of the almighty Sons Of Northern Darkness! The first music I heard from Immortal was the latest release ""Sons Of Northern Darkness"", and I was instantly hooked! I promptly picked up ""At The Heart Of Winter"", and, after hearing others in their catalog, regard this as their second greatest release. The music is varied and interesting to listen to (unlike Battles In The North...sorry guys!) with awesome riffs all over the place! It's been a while since I've been this excited about a band and am in awe of the power they incorporate into their playing. Although there are only 6 tracks, there is not a single bad song on here. You don't have to be a fan of so-called ""Black Metal"" (I'm not!) to love this album. I'm sure it will be one of my favorite CD's that I bought this year (and I buy a lot of music). Great artwork too! A must-have for the collection of any fan of real metal!"
1208.3."Very Pretty Cake Dome Set - Excellent Price Very pretty and well made cake dome set. Love the way it looks. The only thing that I don't like is that the dome it pretty heavy."
1209.2."Beautiful but Misrepresented The Cake dome set was beautiful. I needed a 14 inch diameter plate because I was making a 12 inch cake. The lid had an 11 inch diameter so would not fit the cake. I was disappointed because when I search Amazon for the 14 inch cake plate; there were many unrelated products choices. It was very frustrating. Amazon, please only give unasked for alternatives. I know I am going to google search my product choices to find websites that only give me what I want!"
1210.4."Unnecessarily Dense but Useful Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software. It's an interesting and complete theory of story too, which is great. The book in general is well worth reading. My only problem is that if it's worth saying, it's worth saying WELL and this book uses twice the number of words it needs. The density of words also confuses the message. I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness."

1215.5."Help! I can't stop playng this CD! And I never thought I would go for bluegrass, always conjuring up images of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in my mind. Leave it to Dolly to educate me. This music is extraordinary: very intricate all-stringed arrangements headed off by Parton's lovely, shimmering vocals. The lyrics are pretty much standard, straight-on country, but the singer is so heart-felt, she invests them with so many colors and nuances, she might as well be performing Shakespeare. Thanks, Dolly, for a truly GREAT CD!"
1216.5."This is a stellar piece of music. Coming from someone whose musical preferences run the gamut, from Mariah Carey to Portishead to the Cardigans and back to Geri Haliwell, these words hold quite a bit of meaning. I had read reviews of the album which touted it as the ""best of her career"" and, of course, was skeptical. I can say with complete honesty that this Bluegrass was something I was unfamiliar with, but something I have come to greatly appreciate. The music is fresh and live, different from any mainstream pop we hear nowadays, and is well-deserving of a listen by anyone with an ear for music, whether they are a city boy (Bronx, NY here) or not. Good music has a way of transcending boundaries, and this is one of those discs."
1217.4."Essential Dolly Parton Dolly has described this CD as her ""Blue Mountain"" CD. Part Bluegrass, part mountain music. This is as good as it gets. Dolly never fails to deliver and if you are a Dolly fan or a fan of good music in general, you will not be disappointed."
1218.5."DOLLY IS STILL QUEEN OF COUNTRY MUSIC ! DOLLY PARTON HAS SHOWN WITH THIS AMAZING ALL BLUEGRASS ALBUM, THE GRASS IS BLUE, WHY SHE CAN STILL CARRY THE TITLE OF QUEEN OF COUNTRY MUSIC. DOLLY IS NOT GETTING THE RADIO AIRPLAY THAT SHE STILL DESERVES. SO SHE LEFT COUNTRY MUSIC AND RELEASED AN ALL BLUEGRASS ALBUM THAT IS IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTING. I STRONGLY FEEL DOLLY WILL WIN A GRAMMY FOR THIS WORK OF PURE MOUNTAIN MUSIC ART. ALSO A WARM WELCOME TO THE RECENT HALL OF FAME MEMBER!"
1219.4."Great Modern Bluegrass I'm a casual bluegrass fan and I really enjoy this album. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited for this style of music and the musicians she uses are obviously some of the best in the business.The only complaint I have is that, at only about 45 minutes, this album is too short. Dolly sings on every cut and I don't think it would have hurt to give this stellar band an instrumental number or two. If this album had two or three extra tracks (instrumental or otherwise) I would have given it five stars.""This album is too short"" could be considered a compliment and in this case that's partially what it is. Although I would liked to have gotten a little more quantity for my money, the quality of the music could not be better."
1220.1."Slick, over-produced bluegrass I hate to disagree with so many people who love this CD, but I find very little to like about it. I found the ballads weepy, the upbeat songs cliched, and the singing/musicianship professional but uninspiring. To give you an idea of my tastes, my favorites are Nashville Bluegrass Band ""American Beauty"", Steve Earl/Del McCrory Band ""The Mountain"", Ricky Skaggs/Kentucky Thunder ""Bluegrass Rules"". In my opinion, ""The Grass is Blue"" does not approach the artistic standards of these and many other current CD's. Once again, no offense is intended to the many people who are so fond of this CD. The bottom line: I plan on making the day of somebody who wants to own this CD by selling my copy to a used CD store."
1221.1."Band saves CD As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work."
1222.1."Only for the ""Waltons"" I love ya Dolly, but this music is the WHACK, or it is to this city boy! This is a Cd only the Waltons could love!"
1223.4."Focus Since many music genres, among them the ""Latin American"" traditions from which Lhasa draws inspiration, use a limited aural palette and philosophy as a starting-point for individual compositions, I think it unfair to criticize Lhasa for her lyrical and aural restrictions. I would rather hear her and her band express themselves well using a limited repetoire than to barely-adequately play a dozen styles. That's called ""the eclectic approach"", and it's been far too hyped lately."
1224.5."She could be sister, friend or mother... Lhasa's music:Her music crosses language/race boundaries. As a person who bond very strongly with female singers (eg. Kate Bush, Billie Holiday, Cesaria Evora), Lhasa's music speaks to me as if she is a close female friend, sister or mother.Amazing, intriguing voice. Simple yet dramatic; dramatic yet uncontrived.her velvet resonance and the beauty of the songs will slip unnotice past your defenses and touch the private self.I heard only about 30 seconds of the song ""de cara a la pared (Face to the Wall)"" on the show ""Due South"", but that was enough to make me determine to track down singer and song. I managed to do so on the net. And to my amazement, I found ""La Llorona"" in Singapore's HMV..."
1225.5."bought this as a christmas gift for a friend I gave this cd to my friend for christmas & this is what she emailed to me: I've got my discman set up with the little speakers on my desk and I'm listening to Lhasa. I love that girl! Song 9 (playing now: ""Pajarol, tu me despertaste..."") reminds me a little of the Klezmatics--kind of that Eastern European gipsy feeling... Makes me want to get up, smash my coffee cup and start dancing, with the belly beads showing...."
1226.5."I feel my skin with her voice. Lahasa, your music touches me in places which needed dusting. your gift reminds me i have a heart, skin, teeth, beauty. thank you. thank you. thank you."
1227.4."Almost perfect CD The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!"
1228.2."Too much noise for nothing? Reading the numerous exalting critiques of this new CD by Lhasa, I finally gave in and bought it... I have to admit, that the exoticism of the ""haunting"" style of interpretation can be captivating to the ones not familiar with the Mexican or Latin-American musical traditions. However, the various musical styles appropriated in this CD merit greater diversity in interpretation."
1229.2."Not better than Chavela Vargas but certainly prettier After all these reviews, it is difficult to not feel like I would be doing an injustice ... yet, I think that those who claim to like Lhasa would much prefer the originality and talent of Chavela Vargas. Indeed, Lhasa's raspy voice is deeply influenced by the cigarrette-smoking Vargas. What is called haunting voice, or passion, by other reviewers, is a mode of interpretation that Lhasa administers indiscriminately to every song in her repertoire, especially when the CD includes merry Chrismas songs."
1230.2."Frida's more attractive soundtrack sister Utterly amazing and unique sound. Her voice is so powerful."
1231.1."Disappointing One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song ""Mi Cara de Pared,"" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer."
1232.5."A fun-filled fantasy adventure ""Castle"" is a wonderful book for children who have short attention spans. It provides adventure and re-affirms the laws of chivalry."
1233.4."A Great Fantasy Book This was a great fantasy book. I think it was good because it was full of action and imagination. It is especially good if you like knights and wizardry. This book was about a kid named William who goes on a spectacular adventure with a knight. He runs into trouble and has to defeat a wizard on the way. I recommend this book because it is fun to read and keeps you on the edge of your seat."
1234.4."good for a young reader just got this book since i read it when i was younger and loved it. i will reread it one of these days, but i bet its pretty lame 15 years later, oh well."
1235.2."Very Disappointed As a teacher, I've enjoyed using this book over the years in my reading program. Imagine my excitement when I learned that the book is on audio. Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!? This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your own production. I'm amazed that Winthrop allowed this lemon to get out, especially since she is reading on it. Go Figure!"
1236.4."This Book RULES!.... It is a very good book full of magic and castles,abou t a 11 year old gymnast that shrimks his self to save a magical toy's kingdom. A very good book for those who like the medival times."
1237.5."Castle in the Attic Castle in the Attic is a masterpiece beyond childhood recognition. Ms. Winthrop has woven a tale not confined to the limits of a child's imagination, but one that tests the mature intellect. Christian parents will be pleased to discover that while magic is a recurring theme in this book, it proves to be mearly a side story to the more important and intreguing prospect of William's character development. I recomend to any parent this book for their young son. It speaks of Honor and Chivalry in the face of evil, of strength and tender souls. What this book speaks of in regard to emotional strength is something that every child, and even adult, needs to discover; That to Cry is not Cowardice, to be tender hearted is not Weakness, and that Honor and courage is the Heart of a Knight."
1238.4."An incredible piece of work! This book, by Elizabeth Winthrop was one of the best books I've ever read. It was a real page turner! The end of every chapter left me wanting to read on. If you love fantasies too, I strongly recommend you pick up this one today!"
1239.4."The Castle in the Attic The Castle in the Attic was a great book. It was about a boy called William. His family friend babysitter was leaving. She gave him a castle. William and his toy knight go on an adventure for his babysitter. It was an awesome book. I would recommend The Castle in the Attic to everybody."
1240.3."Castle in the attic reveiw This book showed how sometimes imagination can make a really interesting reality. Being fiction and all we thought it was very interesting. It was very intriguing and we didn't want to put the book down. It was full of magic fantasy and challenges for the characters to face. This book is a good read-a-loud book great for class room discussions. We thought it was interesting how they described the forest when William was traveling to defeat Alastar. Two thumbs up!(...)"
1241.2."The Castle in the Attic i read the castle in the attic and i thoght it wasn't very entrtaning. but that's just my opinion. i thought on some of the chapters it dragged on and lost me alot. like it would talk about one thing and then another without alot of detail. for my opinion, it was an ok book. it had it's moments like whats going to happen next then it was really boring."
1242.1."worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!"
1243.1."My review The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia. And he has a baby sitter that stays with him for 13 years and desides to go back to her home in England. William doesnt want her to go so he takes her picture of her husband who died in the world war 2. She finds out and is said for him and gives William a go away gift which was a huge toy castle with a led knight."
1244.4."The Castle in the Attic Do you believe in dragons and magical lands? Well, if you do then this book is for you! Willam's house keeper is moving away. He doesn't want her to go.He tries to make her stay. Before she leaves she gives him a castle. Next thing he knows he's on a fantastic journey to free the land from a evil wizard. Will the wizzard catch him and turn him into lead. Read this book to find out. Recommended for 3rd graders and up.By Sam"
1245.2."small The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small.I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.The shoes are still too small.."
1246.3."It's okay. I'm using it for track at school as a sprinter. It's okay, but to hold it together is a velcro strap. So you either use the laces or take them out and use only the velcro. Also, if you order them, order them a half size or a full size biggerthen your normal size or else it'll be a tight squeeze. Plus side, you can still run on your toes in them."
1247.4."Bubble Gum Crisis This music CD went along fairly well with the action and theme seen in the show, Bubble Gum Crisis. I guess that kind of figures, as it's the sound track for the show, but it was very good. I'm not a music critic, but that is my opinion. If you were a fan of the show, this CD is a must-have."
1248.3."Nice Aesthetics, Poor Functionality Over Time I bought this case about 3 years ago when I graduated with my M.Arch degree. I keep it in a small pocket inside my purse which is rather protected, and over time, it has deteriorated. The pin that is in the hinge constantly slips out and I have to push it back in, I find it difficult to open with such a small tab, and the clear cover (acrylic?) has cracked in several places. I find it quite awkward to hand out cards at a moment's notice because I have to turn it just right in order to get a good grip to open it. Nice idea, but I'll be sticking to something that lasts a bit longer and is easier and quicker to open. Let your business card tell people what you do - not your case."
1249.4."Timely Delivery Sender made the transaction very smooth and pleasant. Delivery was on time as expected. The book, itself, was rather intriguing and very well written in details."
1250.3."I really liked this book This book is great. I loved the way Blaise and Thea battled over Eric, though they should have given Blaise a soulmate too. I would like to know what happens to Thea and Eric after they go to live with his mom"
1251.5."A very good book This is one of the many LJ Smith books I read and eventhough it is not the best, it was certainly very interesting... LJ Smith's books are very original and that's the main reason why I like reading them....I prefer all her other books about vampires though..since I'm a vampire freak..but I would encourage anyone to read this book...It's simply great!"
1252.5."Best witch book i've ever read!!! Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
1253.3."Spellbinder is... Well, let me just say that a lot of the reviews AND the back cover of the book are a teensy bit misleading. I mean they lead people to believe that Blaise is just bad and doing what she does out of spite which is NOT true and they also make the book sound cliche you know two dogs one bone, the horror! This book isn't like that, I mean it is good althought the male characters were a bit ah wimpy? Of course that's to be expected with two dynamic witches around. The plot could've used a teensy bit of work, but it's not like Smith didn't really know what she was talking about because it seems like she did (I have a friend who's into wicca and stuff). The two cousins are well developed characters and for the most part the connections between the characters are very well done. All in all I'd say this book is worth a read if you've got free time and nothing much else to do. Especially if you're into romance stuff, which I'm not... If I were I'd have probably given it another star."
1254.5."Thanks for the info!!! I just wanted 2 say that I'm a real bookworm and I loved this book! I also want 2 thank L.J.Smith for putting in the book actual spells.(I'm a witch.) I've been looking for some of those like,forever"
1255.5."Magic, Love and Witchy Women........ This book is one of the greatest of the nightworld series. This book is about gentle, nature loving Thea and her wild beautiful cousin, Blaise.Thea falls in love with a human but since the rules of the nightworld state that she can't love a human Thea finds herself in a situation that could turn deadly......Blaise willing to do anything for her cousin tries to lure Eric into her trap and get him away from Thea for good!This has to be my favorite of the series. It was interesting to see the nightworld from the witches point of view and Thea and Blaise are great characters. Especially Blaise, she's no airhead beauty but like her name a bright blaze of passion, intelligence, and loyalty."
1256.4."Spellbinder is Spellbinding! Unlike the first two books in the series Spellbinder switches it's romantic connections to witches insted of vampires. Blaise uses human men as toys till they go crazy, and when she sets her eyes on Eric, Thea's soulmate Thea will do anything to protect him, even if it means breaking the laws of the Night World. A great addition to the series that will have you excited to read more. Though it's a step down from Daughters of Darkness it stands well on it's own."
1257.4."Pretty Good... The plot was okay, the characters were great, and the conclusion interesting. But it was not as good as other Night World Books. But still worth getting."
1258.5."Great! This book like all of L.J.Smith's other books is absolutely divine! I luved it. Blaise was a perfect witch in my opinion. The only thing that disturbed me was the awful torture chamber for Halloween in the Gym. How can people actually laugh about that (I've met people who think it's funny)?"
1259.3."Mediocre product I ordered these with high hopes that they would do the job for me but it turned out not to be the case. The left hand drill bits did not seem very sharp at all and were not able to make any progress on the bolt which was stuck. The screw extractors were not close to the same level of quality of a standard Black and Decker one which could be bought at Home Depot."
1260.4."Quality reverse drill bits & EZ Outs at a good price Good little set of reverse drill bits and corresponding EZ Outs. The #4 bit however, is a little short for the case, and if it is not closed properly, the bit will stick out of the case. This is how it was shipped, denting the case a little bit. The bit does not look damaged, but I have not used it yet."
1261.5."Excellent! One of the best baseball books ever! Although most of the players from the 1961 Cincinnati Reds are forgotten now (exception: right fielder and National League MVP Frank Robinson), this book remains current due to the good humor and insider's view it affords the reader. Nearly 40 years old now, it shows how timeless the game of baseball is.I'm a lifelong NY Yankees fan, but this remains one of my favorite books on any subject.One note: this is one of the only baseball books that was _really_ written by the named author. Brosnan had no ghostwriter."
1262.4."A very good follow-up to a baseball classic Jim Brosnan's second book is also a diary, this one on his 1961 season spent with the eventual National League champion Cincinnati Reds. Brosnan's wit, cynicism, and wry observations on the game of baseball make this an entertaining read. He enjoys interacting with his teammates (most of the time) and one conversation in particular involving Brosnan getting on a teammate for his grammar is priceless. It would have been nice had Brosnan included his spring training experience and the Reds' involvement in the World Series that year. Despite lacking those two elements, ""Pennant Race"" is an easy recommendation. It's not as good as ""The Long Season"", but it's still a very good read."
1263.4."A Great Book for Baseball fans This is a very entertaining book that will appeal to all baseball and/or Cincinnati Reds fans. It's a day to day diary of events in Cincinnati's 1961 pennant winning season prepared by relief pitcher Jim Brosnan. It's easy to read, and you'll enjoy Brosnan's humor. Additionally, it gives great insight into the personalities of the star and every day players of the time."
1264.3."NOT TOO BAD, SOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDED! NOT TOO BAD! THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS ITEM IS, WHILE VACUUMING, SHOULD ONE'S THUMB TOUCH THE SWITCH (even barely), THE VACUUM SWITCHES OFF; this could be annoying."
1265.2."too thin to hold weight this product is good for child I guess..cause it is a little thin...but it is better than the one I saw on sports authority which is thiner"
1266.1."This is NOT a VHS tape, It's a music CD. This was sent to me by mistake. So free it was but not a bargain.I dislike this imported 2 disc, 40 tract album very much. The is from the 30's I would think. With high quality headphones this stuff is to hard to listen too.The sound is very thin and hissy. Fidelity is low and overall listen-ability is very weak. This big band stuff without the big band sound. Song after song, it all sound the same, very boring material with sound to match. Just a throw-away."
1267.2."STOP. We waited 8 months for THIS ? I was so looking forward to Tomb Raider: AOD coming out in November 15th 2002. Then it got delayed, then delayed again, and again, and again, and again. When it finally came out (8 MONTHS LATER) I was really excited. I put the game in my PS2. And was really shocked at how bad this game was. I was expecting something incredible. But no. Lara moves like a robot, it is very difficult to control her, loads of bugs and its boring. No fun. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan and have played them all. But I think this one might be making a trip back to the shop for a refund. However, the graphics are incredible (best i've seen in any game), lara looks amazing and the music is great. But overall I am very dissapointed. EIDOS, get it right next time."
1268.4."Okay, so its not like the old TR games... but that doesn't mean it's not good. I mean, the game, like a lot of things in life, must evolutionized some times or other. And Tomb Raider is doing exactly that. So it is different. Lara also no longer runs, but walks for the most part. So what? I think it's a nice change. Sure it will take some time to get used to the changes, but it isn't bad. And for all the people who are complaining about how slow the game is, you know what? You need to get newer computers. Just because your computer fulfills the minimum requirement needs doens't mean it will be good. I have a fairly new computer and it runs perfectly."
1269.2."Maybe next time... I, like a lot of people writing reviews, play a lot of first person shooters. If you liked Splinter Cell, buy TRAOD USED!!! I agree with everyone here...story is good, controls are less than mediocre. Even Enter the Matrix blew this game away. Customizing the keyboard helps some, but less than what I expected. I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS, but to no avail. Hopefully, if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer. And for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc, I can assure you that is NOT the case."
1270.1."waste of money!!!!! Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message."
1271.2."Should have waited to release, rather than sacrifice quality This is, by far, the most bug filled game I have ever played. The new control system is extremely clumsy and will leave Lara die-hards wondering what the developers were thinking when they decided to revamp the old one. I hate to say it, but I think EIDOS was more concerned about not missing another promised release date and sent out an unfinished product; the obvious quality issues are apparent in the first chapter and get progressively worse. I would not be surprised if the company has to issue a recall for this defective product. On a positve note, the improved graphics are beautiful, but are hard to appreciate because of the frustrating gameplay."
1272.2."Absolutely awful controls! DO NOT BUY I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. I love them. I was so excited to get this one, and sooooo disappointed with the quality. Glitchy glitchy glitchy. Do not buy this game. The controls are terrible. While all other 5 games play out smoothly, this one is slow, stalls, goes blank some times, and takes minutes to load to new chapters. Now I don't have a fancy schmancy computer, but I have been able to play all the other games on it just fine without any hitch. This is just crap. It makes me feel like I have to go buy a $2000 computer just to be able to play this $30 game! It probably runs better on a PS 2, so if you have one of those don't bother with the PC version. Thanks a lot Eidos, I totally wasted time and money and am warning future buyers to BEWARE!"
1273.1."Robocop dressed like Lara Croft I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants.The graphics and sound are great, but Lara rotates like a robot and when I try to make her run, she doesn't agree with me and moves extremely slowly.I have a 2MHz PC with 500Megas RAM and GeForce4 Graphic Card, and there is no possibility that only this game needs to practice Ctrl-Alt-Del each 15 minutes in order to play it.I'll find the way to sell my game and suggest Eidos to make a research in order to define how many of the customers are really satisfied with this game and determine if a refund to the customers is the better way to maintain the good image of Eidos until today.It's a shame."
1274.1."Do Not Buy This Game Inspite of the two patches offered by Eidos the game crashed very often. Lara's movements are hard to control and choppy in stairwells. You will be nothing but disappointed if you spend your hard earned money on this game."
1275.1."Don't waste your money I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off. The controls in the PC version are an absolute nightmare and make what could have otherwise been a decent game horrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever. Good thing two successful movies have been made about this game otherwise EIDOS would've been out of business with this horrendous offering. In fact I'll think twice before purchasing anything with the EIDOS name or CORE DESIGN name attached to it."
1276.1."This [stinks] I will have to assume this game is going [to stink] Why would it's release be pushed back a third time? I am tired of waiting. This game must be so bad that Eidos/Core must feel it needs some severe refinement before release.On top of the release date changes, neither Eidos or Core have bothered to put the news up on thier sites. ..."
1277.3.old tomb raider new game first off dont get me wrong i love this game but in most of the tomb raider games you get two pistols with infinite ammo you never get those guns in AOD that is the first thing the controls are way different than any other TR game and for two or three levels you play as a guy that really set me off the great thing about other TR games is its not like every othor steriotypical video game you play as a girl thats cool well i think if your gonna buy a TR game buy a game thats like 75 cents and is a classic iinstead of a $30$ game that is gonna ruin the series
1278.1."Bad Eidos, Bad! Oh. My. God. I remember when Tomb Raider first came out, and my husband and I got it on the original PlayStation. It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you'd better come to love the phrases ""save successful"" and ""load successful"" because that's what you'll do, over and over and over! It's completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it! This game wasn't even worth the discounted price I picked it up for. Don't buy it, it's a trick..."
1279.4."Worth the wait, minus some glitches. Not as explosive as the earlier titles but this game keeps you wanting more. The graphics are above avg. and the camera mostly does what it should. The sound draws you into the game like before, hearing things coming and looking away from the tv as if they were in your house. There are a few glitches when you read some of the many clues, under the Louvre I had something that repeated for what seemed like forever. I just made it to Prague and can't wait to get off work to play again. Fans will still have the puzzles and mazes that take hours to clear a room. This isn't a shooter though, Lara fights but not often, at least not early in the game. Alot of hidden places that you don't have to go to to complete the game, not little rooms with a medi-pac but large rooms with ajoining rooms. Just buy it, if you have a month or so to invest into being in front of your tv on the edge of your seat."
1280.4."Lara croft, angel of darkness The graphics on this game are really really good.A big downer is the controls, it used to be really easy but now you`ve got no choice but to use the anolog buttons and i hate them!The locations are very detailed and the interaction of friends and enemies is very impressive.But, i`m not sure that it was a good idea to bring in another character.overall, a very good game worth the money, v.good graphics and locations. The only set backs to this game are the controls, and the extra character."
1281.1."Angel of darkness is correct This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change."
1282.2."One would think......... Hmmmm, as a veteran of Tomb raider and an someone who plays most of the 1st person shooters that appear I was quite disappointed in the game controls. The story is great, the graphics are much better then previous Tomb Raider releases but the controls ruined the game for me. One would think with all the 1st person shooters with very precise and smooth controls Tomb Raider would have them too, not so. It is very frustrating to try and play a very well done story only to continually die for lack of the ability to accurately control Lara's movement. I hope Edios learns from this experience."
1283.3."Not what I was expecting! OK, just got the game last week, and I was soooo excited, but started to play, and was a little disappointed when I found her so hard to control. And what is with the slow motion? Every once in a while it looks like instant replay during your game play, either this, or Laura is severely tired and has to slow down. What's the deal? Also, the camera angles are a little difficult to get used to, I am still adjusting. The graphics are great, but I think a little more work should have been done on the controls; she is just too difficult to move sometimes. Jumping is not the same anymore, and why must she walk before she starts to run? Before it was straight out running, and now, she has to take about 3 or 4 steps before she starts running. I am still hanging in there; I believe it must get better. I am still playing, so I guess I will just have to adjust to the ""new and supposedly improved"" Laura."
1284.1."Come on here people... This control sceme made Tomb Raider 1 unplayable. This control scheme kept me from passing the TRAINING levels of TR: Last Revelations. This control scheme was horrible but barely useable when I played Resident Evil. This control scheme caused me to die like a thousand times on the first level when I played Fear Effect. This control scheme is still compleyely horrible in this game.Would someone please tell Eidos to change the controls in any future Tomb Raider games. I really want to like this series but every one of these games has been unplayable due to the control scheme."
1285.4."Exceeds expectations This is my 3rd pressure washer and by far the best of the breed. It is solid piece of work that is easy to move about when doing the deck(s)with wheels that actually work. Santa gave me the one with the roll-up hose which is very nice feature. Only problem was that the User guide didn't have any information on this feature so I spent a few minutes trying to figure out where or how to connect the high pressure hose to unit- Guess What? - No need to connect anything except garden hose. I consider this tool the best buy for your $$$$"
1286.4."My new electric power washer McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer #FHH18AHave used the washer a couple of times and found it easy to operate. It has done the jobs I purchased for a snap. For the time being I find the product of good quality. It appears sturdy & I have the impression it will be a long time before I need another jet washer.The vendor shipped promptly.NGA"
1287.4."Gets the job done It does an excellent job on mildewed wood such as decks and deck furniture without using chemical mode which is the only weak link in an otherwise strong chain. Unfortunately, the only effective chemical solution is chlorine which acts more or less on its own but cannot be used with this machine. Safe cleaners, such as Simple Green are no more effective than when used without them. Other than that, it's a great product."
1288.1."Do not buy this Brand!!! I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."
1289.2."Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing. Too many cheap plastic parts. Consider it to be disposable if you buy it."
1290.2."Worked at first When we got this product it worked great. After a year though, the pressure is next to non-existent and I cannot find a troubleshoot guide to find out what the problem is, or how to fix it. I consider myself very handy and can usually figure these things out, but this one has me stumped. It acts like there is air getting into the system and the result has been damage to the motor or something.The company is absolutely no help at all in advice for fixing this machine.Sorry, but I cannot recommend it as highly as those who are doing so."
1291.3."Small washer for small jobs Bought new @ Menards, used several times to clean screened in room floor, garage floor, wash car & truck. Works good on small jobs. Biggest complaint: the cheap plastic hose connector broke shortly after using & sounds like a common problem many have had. Checked online for replacement part @ $1.39 but shipping costs more than the part! Think I'll check my local hardware store for a universal hose connector if there is such a thing. Too bad a cheap broken part makes the washer totally unusable."
1292.4."McCulloch 1800 PSI power washer Super easy to set up and use. Lots of water pressure, tons of hose, and an extra long electrical cord. It also wheels around nicely. I'm excited to use the attachments."
1293.4."McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer I like it. I live on the west side of the Cascade Range in Oregon and things get dingy pretty quick. I had my vehicle, the rain gutters on the house, landscaping bricks along the path around the house, and odds and ends all washed in about an hour. It works great. The only drawback that I can find is that it doesn't appear to suck up any cleaning solution in the high pressure mode. Only the low pressure. I haven't tried the upper tank yet so maybe that's the problem. Not a huge issue since plain water pretty much takes everything off anyway. The plastic double male hose attachment was a concern before I purchased the unit. I'd read that most of them broke pretty quick. As long as you are aware not to stress it out dragging it around, it will probably last a good long time. If it does break it should be easy to replace pretty cheap. Again great unit so far."
1294.1."failed after 2nd application i never got this to work, it shorted out and is made out of cheap plastic. didn't come with all the attachments would not recommend this product"
1295.5."Great series I have several titles in this series--they're great! The recipes are easy to make and clearly set out, and there is always an introductory chapter on the herb or spice covered by the book. There are several other titles in this series: coriander, ginger, garlic, chocolate, etc."
1296.2."Great Work, Poorly Organized Kindle Book This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!"
1297.5."Always a great book... All I can say is that this is a nice nearly complete compilation of his work. A must read in my educated opinion."
1298.3."Insect This didn't cover as many inseck pictures as I thought it would. Was a gift for great grandson and I thought it would show pictures of more insects than it did."
1299.5."Good primer. Great book for an overall look at insects. Doesn't go into great depth on any one topic or insect, but provides a great cross section of information. Purchased this for my son and will admit that as usual, the DK illustrations caught my eye and I ended up reading the book too. This is a great series of books for kids that really captures their attention."
1300.5."Excellent Educationl Text I'm a teacher and I find the Eyewitness books highly educational. I like the way the concepts are presented in a form without backgrounds. This gives clear facts to the reader without over taxing the attention span. The books are highly informative, presenting difficult concepts in comprehendable chunks that stimulate interest. I have almost the whole collection for my own children and they LOVE them!"
1301.4."Wonderful! A wonderful book, beautifully done, which never fails to fascinate children.For such a short book it's surprisingly complete. Perhaps most importantly of all, it encourages children to look for further information, and directs them to good sources (including the bugs in their own backyards!). The inexpensive used copies that are available make this a don't-miss."
1302.4."Philosophic Classics There is a huge range of authors in this book, and it includes most of the main ideas from each original passage. It can be sort of hard to follow at times, however, as it leaves out giant parts of arguments, especially in The Republic. This really breaks down the flow of the piece and renders it much more confusing than the original book."
1303.5."REMASTER 2012! GOTTA HAVE IT! So, what I've always wanted was a clean digitally remastered version of ""Pom Pom Play Girl"" in MONO! The stereo is rechanneled with Carl singing on one channel and the guys singing on the other! The Mono ""FUN, Fun, Fun is also a ""Must Have"" in Mono to get the full benefit of Brian's Vocal. The music and vocals are very clean on this CD. The gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music."
1304.2."You can skip this one This is not one of Daignault's better books, it reads like some poorly written nostalgic ego trip, with way too many paragraphs about beating out the regulations on beach buggy laws and surf casting that were put in place in the Cape in the 1970s. The title does certainly does not belie its contents: you indeed feel like it's been 20 years of Daignault on the Cape by the time you're finished reading it."
1305.5."Fantastic Melting Pot of Music Having seen Scruj live a couple of times, and owning a copy of their studio release CD (see their website), I would consider myself a major fan. To quote a friend, ""Are they French, Irish, or American Country?"" Good question. Answer: all of the above.Blending Irish folk music, french fiddles and lyrics, and country twang, Scruj manages to always be true to the styles they worship. Yet they are all so young! If you have not seen them or heard them, do yourself a favor and do whatever it takes! They play such wonderful music with a profound respect for it's origins and it's spirit."
1306.5."Great in different styles !!! The reason that i give this cd 5 stars... it's simple... different styles of house music, compiled on one cd... you will enjoy it a whole time... so it's worth for your money !!!If Jack keeps it in this way... we may expect beautiful things of him in the future !!!"
1307.3."Worth watching... ...okay first of all it is supposed to be a vampire movie, but the vampires act more like zombies. They bite the hell out of any and all bodyparts, they walk like they're zombies, and act like they are zombies. This movie was not bad, except they over did it with the blood. Too much of it is not always a good thing, and it gets old after a while. I would say this is about a three and a half star movie. It is a good addition to your horror library, but not an integral one. I would say rent it first, then if you feel it justifies a purchase then by all means. I don't regret I got it, but I wish I could tell you it is a must have."
1308.2."Guess i missed what was cool I bought this thinking that it was going to be one of those major life-changing experience moments in horror or something. As i said in my title... I guess i missed what was cool. It was ok for a low budget, but even then i guess i just didn't like the story, concept or style of the movie at all. People running down an alley flailing their arms does not invoke terror to me... sorry. So i suppose this movie ranks as a: Either you hate it or Love it kinda thing. Watch a trailer, if you like what you see go for it."
1309.1."""HOME MADE"", Lowest Budget Film... ********* W A R N I N G ! ************* STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE! ****This movie is pretty bad! Ultra low budget movie with terrible acting and a boring plot, which combined with a huge stuggle to stay and watch should have given this one a NEGATIVE FIVE STAR RATING!!!MONEY DOWN THE TUBES WITH THIS ONE!!!"
1310.5."Excellent quality Wonderful product - heavy weight and well made. This has been a delightful and useful addition to my 50's style, diner kitchen."
1311.3."what's about English tradition of jewish music Very interesting items sung by the beautifull Moshe Hachel's voice.I regret the quality of choirs work.The compositions for choirs are very modern and don't seem to be matching a sacred service requirements.The only reason why I would buy this CD is the Moshe Hachel's performance which is wonderfull and outstanding."
1312.2."Good support, but expensive and not durable! I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade."
1313.4."Good muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a"
1314.2."Also ran the first time I wore them I put them on at the doctor's office and the first time I had to take them off, sure enough, ran them. Otherwise, liked them very much."
1315.4."Interesting performance I bought this only because as a fan, I want all of their material. First off, you'll notice the disc length of 76.46. The band added a keyboard player Graham Maitland for this tour which at first is a bit hard to digest(mixed too far up front)sometimes the keyboards work, other times not. There are some classics here- 'The king will come', 'Persephone', 'Time Was' as well as a few others. Sound quality is average, sounds like a straight transfer with no doctoring with the sound. This is the Mark 2 lineup with Laurie Wisefield. Not one of the best concert offerings by the band but worthwhile. I'm sure the band has some real gems in their archive like the live tracks on the superb 'Distillation' box set. Sadly they are not contained on this disc. If you can get past the keyboards and the muddy sound quality, you may enjoy it. Somehow I feel only the true fans will want this disc in their collection."
1316.2."Danger..... Watch out for this turkey! Definitely a disk for the true believers only. Sound quality as bad as any bootleg I have ever listened to, some songs fade (on a live album!?) and skimpy liner notes add up to a pretty bad package. And the addition of a keyboard player seems to hurt rather than add to WA's sound. If you are dying for a live disk from WA's ""Locked In"" tour, this will have to do. Otherwise, save your money."
1317.5."Real cultured butter of high quality I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc."
1318.4."A pleasant travelogue, slightly dated but that's ok Ejoyable stories from the early 1980's by an author who waxes a bit nostalgic for the British Empire. Well written with dry humor. A languid pace. Never dull."
1319.3."Kind of Annoying I can live with the chapters that are outdated; I mean, Winchester wrote this two decades ago, the 'first published' date tells you this. I see no need for him to have to update anything. It's a travel book from the early 1980's.What did annoy me though was Winchester's constant and, one must assume, deliberate ploy of interchanging the words English/ England with British/ Britain, as if they meant the same thing.Whether Winchester liked it or not (and I'm sure he probably didn't) the Empire was British; England may well have been in control but the constant interchange often found in the same paragraph is a real kick in the teeth to the hundreds and thousands of Welsh and Scots that helped form the fledgling Empire.The book cover has the Union Flag on it. It's there for a reason."
1320.3."Too outdated to matter Darn - what are these places like today - not 30 years back? Turks &Caicos are now bustling - Bermuda is large off shore banking capital, and Monserrat is no more. Hong Kong is transformed into China."
1321.3."Lacking in content, but some inspiring photos. As an experienced bookmaker, I was anxious to try some of the projects in this book. BE VERY CAUTIOUS! I found many errors in measurments in this book, which can cost you valuable paper and time! This book can be very vague about what size your papers should be and exactly how much of it you need. If you simply rely on what the author says, you may find yourself frustrated with a project that didn't work out.Other than that, there are some nice inspirational pictures in the book, but I don't know if that justifies the purchase. So, unless you're prepared to do some serious math/measurment checking, I'd go with a book that the editors actually took time to edit."
1322.1."WARNING - Does Not Help This is one of those books that copies all of the information from other books and tries to call it their own (an does not give all the information needed to do the few examples). If need information on bookbinding, the best I have found is Hand Bookbinding: A Manual Of Instruction by Aldren Watson (also available here)."
1323.2."A disappointing and frustrating read I was eager to read this book because it's set in a part of the world (upstate NY) where I spend a lot of time and it exactly the kind of neo-Gothic tale I usually love. She has talent, it's undeniable, but Scott is far too enchanted with her own writing to tell a decent story. Every time I found myself beginning to be captivated by the narrative or the chatacters, I'd stumble across a highly polished, self-conscious set-piece of prose that screamed ""HEY! Look at me...don't I write well?!"" After a second attempt to finish this book I am giving up on it and moving on."
1324.2."Good, but only to the midway point This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer."
1325.2."Victorian???Hardly! To call this a collection of Victorian erotica is inaccurate as this implies that all the stories are from that era. I felt rather cheated to realise that a few were obviously twentieth century additions. It might have been more accurate to have titled this a Collection of 18th -20th Century Erotica"
1326.3."Victorian Directory This book is essentially a directory of Victorian erotica, recapping highlights of each major effort (of which there are many). Should the reader be expecting something else, he or she will almost certainly be disappointed."
1327.2."Truncated It would have been nice if the editor included a bibliography, so people could read an entire novel. For example, The ""Romance of Lust"" selection doesn't do its author justice. The original is a big book, wherein the author couldn't possibly have held a job anywhere since he devoted his entire day to erotic diversions. No one was safe, not even his aunt and sisters. Well, maybe the family dog. Other selections were uninteresting too. Is the editor really a Major? Why do we need his military rank in such a book? Is he still in active duty???"
1328.1."Waste of money This looked like it would be lots of fun but it's very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all. Dont waste your money"
1329.1."Just in case anyone is as stupid as I am This may be the best product out there ... I wouldn't know because I had no idea what I was ordering. It didn't dawn on me when it said pneumatic that I had to have an ""air supply"" ... plus it doesn't have any grinding points. I just wanted something to etch my name on the metal prints of my artwork. So back it goes and I'll look for something that's simple enough for me to understand what it is and how to use it."
1330.4."DON'T go to ebay. Nothing except bootlegs and crooks. It costs a lot because its an IMPORT, not a bootleg! If you're going to enjoy the CD, might as well enjoy it knowing that you didn't pay too much money for a crook to burn the CD for you. Honestly. Things cost money. To a real fan, this is worth the money. Costs a crook a penny to create a mediocre bootleg. Do you really think you're saving money?"
1331.3."Go to ebay You can get all 4 cd's on ebay for about the price your paying for this. If you like the series and the music that goes with it buy it in ebay. If u have cash to throw away then buy it here"
1332.1."I am not impressed with this product! I bought this bag holder to use in my yard to collect leaves anddog droppings. The construction is very flimsy and the little tabs that hold the bag in place are VERY VERY hard to get off!. After several months, it now can barely stand up by itself and I have to constantly tighten the wheels and other screws. It would be nice if it was better made and sturdier and if it had a cover to keep out the flies...It seemed like a great idea, but the products is not well made."
1333.1."Cheaply made product I often struggle when trying to empty the clippings from my lawnmower into a garbage bag and I had hoped that this product would make that task easier. I was disappointed, I must say. The frame is very thin and unstable. The assembly instructions were hard to understand and the product was hard to assemble with only one set of hands. I am not pleased with this product at all. It seems as though it would collapse if I were to use it for my intended purpose. I do not recommend this product at all."
1334.2."Flimsy Bag Holder The product seemed like a good idea but wish I had read all of the reviews before ordering. The product is not sturdy at all. It didn't come with the number of screws noted on the instructions so I had to go out and purchase more in order to finish putting it together. That was after I spent way to much time trying to decipher the instructions. Also, the clips that hold the bag to the frame are very tight and very difficult to put on and remove. I've torn every bag I've used. I hate wasting my money; but, I'll have to buy a better one."
1335.1."flimsy poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. The rubber bag clamps were too difucult to remove so replaced with wood clothespins. Don't bother with this thing."
1336.1."mismached The item as pictured was not sent. Instead a holder was sent that had no provision to hold the leaf bag nor did it have wheels. Not worth the ;money"
1337.1."BUYER BEWARE This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars...."
1338.3."Rolling Leaf bag holder It does the job fine but it is flimsy and will only stand up to light duty. Additionally the screws are constantly loosening up and require retightening.James in Palm Springs, CAGet Organized Rolling Leaf Bag Holder"
1339.1.don't waste your money The worst item I have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money
1340.4."The other side of ""A brave new world "" This science fiction novel walks around the speculative situation about a natural (not social and not even political choice) population distribution, in agreement his skills and gifts.Naturally many facts occur in this interesting tale , but the most remarkable issue is to make us think the elusive dreams about a better and even pacific society."
1341.3."Raises Some Good Questions First of all, like any utopian vision, this book lacks life. Though I think that psychedelics (entheogens) can help some people to get in touch with a larger reality, I dont think that this holds true for everyone. For instance, personal transformation and inner-conflicts were treated simplistically. I did think the dynamic between the peaceloving people of Pala and its internal greedy members as well as outsiders who wished to exploit the island rang true. Would like to give this book a better review, but I can't.Thomas Seay"
1342.3."Utopia? Although it was his last book, I wasn't that impressed. Half the characters were depressing/vulnerable and didn't have much going on. Huxley's ideas and philosophy were in place but it just didn't mesh for me. His earlier works much better."
1343.5.The Distillationof Huxley's Views on Life and Death One of my all time favorite books, glad to have a new copy
1344.3."The Survival Book I think this book was adventerous and scary. It wasn't the best book I've ever read but it was pretty good though. My favorite part was when they fell off the ship. The bad part was that they couldn't fine each other."
1345.2."NOT VERY GOOD..... I decided to read ""Island"" because i enjoyed ""Brave New World"" so much. Well the former is really horrible compared to the latter. It's pretty boring, the plot doesn't make much sense and the main character's ideas are often all over the place.While certain parts of this story are interesting, in it's entirety, i would have to give it two thumbs down :("
1346.1."I would rather chew my leg off than have you read this book. Please let me begin by agreeing with most reviewers that Aldous Huxley was a brilliant man, one of the most forward-thinking men in modern history and (on the whole) a wonderfully gifted writer. That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. ""Island"" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone."
1347.2."Well, not everything It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of ""real life"" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a ""good enough"" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting."
1348.1."Software is Horrible! This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store."
1349.2."Simply Borred Borred, Borred and very borred!! to much bla bla! I spected that this book would say something about ancient phylosopy, something to think about, but never get it, it is very borred."
1350.2."Biography of Wright and his works Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of ""executive summary"" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view."
1351.4."Top Ten List for Christians is in our Top Ten! Our Sunday School Class of Middle aged adults ordered this book for class study. We are having a lot of fun with it and learning a lot at the same time. Great Study."
1352.3."Pretty Box.. I've seen two versions of this set, one has the typical cardboard box, and one comes in a nice metal tin. Mine happens to be the one in the tin which is mainly the reason I got it. For the most part, the transfers of the films are terrible. A lot of the time the pictures get so dark that you can't even tell what's going on. There are 31 shorts in all and I've not watched all of them yet so there may be a few that are of good quality. Over all, the tin looks nice but I wish the films were of better quality."
1353.3."""Rock the Joint!"" is better Now, this was a complete thrill to have for me back when I first started buying Bill Haley CDs in October 2002, but when I heard about ""Rock the Joint!"" I thought this CD was extremely skimpy. It doesn't have the classic ""Rocket 88."" It doesn't have great tunes like ""Green Tree Boogie"" and ""Sundown Boogie."" This is very ... Doesn't even have a booklet, really. Sure, the old recordings at the beginning of his career in 1952 and 1953, but I would rather go with ""Rock the Joint!"" ... This CD includes classics like ""Rock the Joint,"" ""Rocking Chair On the Moon,"" ""Fractured,"" ""Crazy Man, Crazy"" and ""Real Rock Drive,"" though."
1354.3."Bill's early recordings, but not all of them. These are Bill's recordings from the early 50s before he became immensely popular with ""Shake Rattle And Roll"" or ""Rock Around The Clock"". Sadly you don't find all of his great early stuff on this CD, but this is a good starter as the price is really low."
1355.1."Wrong title and director There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes."
1356.2."pretty rough, but it shows promise The playing is merely competent, and the singing sounds like jump rope chanting much of the time. But there are flashes of inspiration. It's unlikely any of these songs will stay with you after the CD is over, nor will you feel much of a draw to put it on again."
1357.3."Its OK I bought this to match the set. The fabric is OK and of good quality. I was disappointed that it was not stuffed more. It is not a firm pillow but a very very soft flat pillow."
1358.5."Lovely stories. Gwen Bristow is an amazing author. Her books may be a mite old fashioned, but she still packs an emotional, historical and cultural punch. Really a great read, as are her other novels. Don't miss out."
1359.4."Almost as Good as the first book in this Trilogy. When I first read all three ""Plantation"" books by Gwen Bristow 20 years ago, I was so enthralled with them that I read them twice!! Well 20 years later and I just read all three of them again this past week. Great books that stand the test of time. Each book can be read alone but I recommend them as a series, loved them years ago and still love them!!"
1360.2."A typical anti-Darwinism pseudoscience book The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's ""semantic"" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press."
1361.2."still the same old guys... Hello again, here we are. This is what I think after listening to the new album of Germanys' Thrash-Metal godfathers.Nothing new but still they rock like hell. Unfortunately they made a step backwards and not like Slayer or Mayhem a step forward. Well, I believe that some old school fanatics will enjoy this feature, but Sodoms'great days are gone. Their last good record was and will be ""Tapping the Vein"". I was a great fan of them for over 12 years but they just repeat themselves. I am not happy about giving such a cruel review about this record but I just had to say that. Sorry guys, better luck next time, ok?"
1362.5."awsome metal dude its like code red was an album from Sodom.This album is scarey and makes me feel cool"
1363.4."Great strategy game! I had experience of RTS games (Total Annihilation, Age of Empires and Empire Earth) and after I bought Praetorians and played the first time, I found it very very interesting.It's not the typical RTS game where you have to produce a lot of units and simply attack the enemy (like for example TA kingdoms or others) but you have to think in a strategic way before moving and attacking the enemy. In this game, mission by mission, you learn how to balance your troops and how to move in the territory. It's important the fact that troops can interact with territory (hills, woods). You can hide your troops, you can stay higher than the enemy and then attack you enemy suddenly (for example,if your bowmen are in a higher position they will hurt more seriously the enemy). In some missions you have to lay siege to a fortess with war machines.To sum up, I think it's a good game, if you want to enjoy yourself and live the experience of ""De Bello Gallico""!"
1364.2.Disappointing I bought this game because my friend said it was excellent, however he's never been a very good gamer, I thought the no resource management idea was ok, but it ruins half the point of an RTS, and strategy is all about careful management of resources to fund your army, because, if you dont have any resources, you dont have an army ;-) I'd say ok for someone who doesn't really know how to play a REAL RTS, but if your an expert, I'd save up for Warcraft 3:The Frozen Throne, and if you haven't got the normal Warcraft 3, go buy it!
1365.1."A Rookie Game Everyone knows that a good strategy game involves somewhat of a steep learning curve and an advanced difficulty level. This game is simply a click and attack real time strategy that does not involve any heavy thinking. In fewer words it's the bunnie slope for youngsters that are just discovering the thrill of these games. In conclusion I feel the word strategy is innapropriate altogether! True strategy players will want to return the product, rookies will like it because they'll feel moderately challenged by it."
1366.2."Elementary Differential Equations [..]Let me warn all potential customers that this book is all about quantity of material instead of quality. While the book does cover such advanced topics as Fourier Analysis and intro to Partial Differential Equations, the book lacks sufficient examples about what is being said (a number of sections have no examples at all).I did find the most well-written sections to be the application of second-order differential equations (applied to spring oscillations etc.) However, as far as getting a bang for your buck, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Morris Tennenbaum and Harry Polland's Ordinary Differential Equations Dover edition (cheaper, and MUCH MORE effective. Trust me)."
1367.2."Difficult to follow I'm a student and am taking a class using this book. I've found it very difficult to follow and short on explanations. Without additional resources, I would not be able to learn the material in this book."
1368.2."elem diff e-q's While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading."
1369.2."Not helpful... I decided to self study AP environmental science, which I eventually received a 5 for. This was a textbook I was considering to use, but I found it to be difficult to read (not to mention a bit politically-oriented). I would recommend Raven and Berg for APES, which is more concise and comprehensive for the test."
1370.2."Not my taste in music Voice too ""breathy"" to suit my taste. I wouldn't say it is bad; just not the kind of music that I like."
1371.4."No escape from noise Run the place red, the first cut, is great. If you like the recent direction being taken by people like Tim Hecker and Amon Tobin, consider this the Richard D. James twist on that cut-up trend, with his trademark super hyper drum track. And, like RDJ's past stuff, suitably nightmarish and queasy.The second two tracks are causing a bit of controversy, consisting as they do mainly of noise and analog-style knob tweaking sounds, high pitched shrieks, some distorted screams, etc. There is no beat, there is no melody, there is little apparent structure (although its marginally more structured than ""Metal Machine Music,"" but only just so). This is some of the most uncompromising music RDJ has done, and for him that's quite a statement. Maybe this is his remix of Subotnick's ""Silver Apples of the Moon"". Anyway, it's not for the faint of heart. It doesn't kick ... and it doesn't make your booty move, so you might want to stay away unless you're a real noise head."
1372.4."Originally $12 People look at this as a piss-take on an EP, just for RDJ's personal wealth and whatnot. And, truthfully, it is.But that doesn't make the one ""real"" track on here not worth the money.It does indeed, grow on you. Or else you love it right away. It's quite a departure from his normal works, rarely can you somewhat understand the lyrics, if there are any.The rest is a collection of annoying noises which will either make you or your neighbours go crazy. Nothing really ""musical"" comes out of them.So albeit is a rubbish of an EP, yet the first track is well worth the price, and if you're into ways of torturing people with different pitches of one noise, then you're set."
1373.4."AFX - Smojphace I think AFX's take on ""Run the Place Red"" is incredibly fun -- it makes me want to jump and shimmy each time I hear it. Now, I'm not a huge fan of ragga, but ragga-jungle-drill 'n' bass? I think it's a genius combination, one that only the demented mind of Mr. James could discover. You can barely understand the vocals beneath the percussion -- they're more flavor than anything else. As for the two noise tracks, they're rather interesting the first time around (not to mention intense on the squeals), but I don't think they stand up to repeated listens. Mostly because I don't want to go deaf."
1374.4."Nothing is what it appears--which is good :) A little research on the internet would show that RDJ has put squealing noise tracks out like this before. The first track is great. However, all the negative reviews of the second and third tracks might be premature. On at least one other AFX CD I had (2 remixes?), the third track was similar witha high pitch and ticking. I recently found out that the third track on that EP was actually a graphic---it's data, not audio, an SSTV image. Likewise, maybe tracks 2&3 on the smojphace CD aren't music, but data. I no longer have the CD to try to decode it myself."
1375.2."ok mr. i like everything aphex twin has ever made (with the exception of ""elephant song""), but this album is a piece of poo covered crust (thats right ""crust""!). i think mr. smiley here is just releasing the stupidest stuff he's ever made as some sort of artsy fartsy nut chunk because these songs stink flamboyantly. the first song features a reggae ""artist"" who has too much self esteem (if your gonna get excited about something dont make it reggae lyrics). anyway i hate lyrics, so i'm a little biased. the other parts in the song consist of drums...and some other insignificant effects. the other songs consist of only the latter; no music just stuff (which i know is arguably music also, but jeez 9 minutes then the next song is the exact same stuff). now i've gone and soiled myself i hope smiley mcgee is happy."
1376.2."What a disapointment. Two years, and this is all we get? The first song is decent. It has some rap/reggae guy doing his vocal thang, with RDJ's music behind the background. Except for the first 10 seconds, the music itself exceptional. Nice crazy d'n'b stuff with vocals. This song is worth getting, but not for $$$ ! The other two tracks... they are just noise. It's as if he hooked up electrodes to his recording equipment and twiddled with the knobs or something. Or maybe he had real songs and then encrypted them. Who knows! They are not music. They're most likely a sick joke by RDJ."
1377.3."hyper spacial weirdness Only true Aphex heads can apreciate this album. The first track offers a killer drum 'n bass journey. very hyper, withRDJ's insane trademark all over it, not run of the mill dn'b or anything. The rhythm fades out into static. It still pounds in your head and pulse as the second track begins which seems to have a distorted rhythm in keeping with the first, but then it just goes ballistic, think of tracks 2 and 3 as the inevitable comedown from the first track. Eat some chocolate covered espresso beans first and you will understand."
1378.2.Raggae Mixed With Some Weird Techno but man yeah yeah yeah its good and all that, but man, 9 dollars for three songs?! isn't that like an oxymoron?
1379.4."Mostly for fans If you don't own anything by the Muffs, get the first self-titled CD or ""Blonder and Blonder"" first. Then come back for this one.This is a collection of alternative versions, demos, covers from compilations, and tunes that just didn't make the cut.It's still the best thing the band has released since ""Blonder and Blonder"". If you are a fan, then the liner notes by themselves are worth ten bucks.And you get 30 tunes for under $10! It's hard to find that kind of bargain these days.Don't make this your first Muffs album, but make it your third."
1380.1."Very Disappointing. I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past."
1381.1."Don't Bother w/the Muffs...just Noise. Bought this CD thinking it would be similar to their cover tune, Kids in America.Was I wrong, this is worst cd I've has the displeasure to listen to.Old chic, lead singer does nothing but scream throughout all the tracks. The tunes are simplistic, lack depth and show no inkling of creativity.If you like endless screaming to nonsensical lyrics then this rubbish is for you."
1382.5."Exactly what it says it is I'm an arts and crafts director for a girlscout camp, so I read a lot of craft books. Klutz really does have the best ones around. These rings are easy, the book gives you everything you need (but scissors) and there are several cute patterns. I'm sure campers will love these projects. The only complaints I have are with the included supplies-- the bead wheel is cumbersome to use, and the colors mix easily. Also, there isn't much variety in beads-- but you can easily supplement with whatever you have on hand."
1383.3."ok item for the price Didnt receive this banner until a week laterDidnt receive a confirmation online. It said it was shipped when it was sitting on my doorstep...Otherwise a great product and catches a lot of attention !!I will honestly say this is definately worth it if you want to fill in a big wall space or want to add a little bit more spice to your tailgate party..weather resistant so it can be outside and it also has metal gromets to hang easily anywhere.."
1384.4."Good, But Not Great It takes a good voice to sing Tobira Wo Akete, the second opening song for the show. In my opinion, Anza did a very good job singing this! The first time you hear this song, most people will think, 'ugh! this song sucks', but trust me, in a while you'll get used to it and love it as much as I do. Yoru no Uta and Tomoe are both sung by Iwao Junko, the voice actress for Tomoyo (Madison). Her voice is very soft and high-pitched, but if you love melancholy songs, you'll love these two songs. Honey is the ending song, very nicely sung [by chihiro], and addicting too. The Sakura version is similar to the song, Shiawase no Mahou.The only reason you should buy this CD is for Tobira Wo Akete, Yoru no Uta, Tomoe, and Honey. I would only suggest this for die-hard CCS fans. If you're not one of them, go buy the CCS Best Collection soundtrack."
1385.2."Not good I didn't find this book at all interesting.. all though there was occasional humor.. in general, i didn't enjoy this piece of literature."
1386.3."Disgusting man, that father -- should have been locked up for the emotional abuse of his children.Clarence Day's writing style is adequate, the book reads quickly (I finished it in two brief sittings), but why Day would want to honor that horror of a father by writing a memoir about him is beyond me.Read the play instead, by Lindsay and Crouse. L & C had the good sense to soften the father's character and make him more palatable. In the play you will find humor, but not in the memoir."
1387.4."Enjoyable memoir I just got this book and I am having a wonderful time reading the anecdotes of life in Victorian New York with an eccentric father. The humor is gentle and quiet, if you want outlandsih jokes the this is not the book for you.Of course, some of the customs and actions of the characters may seem odd by modern standards but we must remember that everything changes with time and in 150 years, people may look back at our culture and wonder if we were crazy.Still, in spite of its age, the humor of the book has held up remarkably well. Perhaps we all know a ""father"" type, an eccentric and bossy person who is somehow endearing nonetheless.So, don't obsess over the un-politically correct attitudes of the time covered, just enjoy the quiet humor and learn about a time gone by."
1388.4."Life with Father (by Clarence Day) I loved this book as a preteen and I loved it, and the sequel ""Life with Mother"" too. Mr. Day paints an accurate picture of life in the early 1900's for a middle class family. Yes, his father is rude and a bit obnoxious, but watching him is very funny. He loved his wife and family and while he blustered and yelled, they loved him. I enjoyed this book and thought it was great."
1389.4."Adventure in geography Would you at the age of 25 leave home and go sailing around the world? Most of us would want to but only few of us would do it. William Albert Robinson was one of the few who took the adventure. It took him three years, three months, and nine days to do it. Robinson encountered cannibals, and head hunters, and Arab tribesmen who captured him and held him for ransom. He escaped them several times to continue on. He was also a keen observer of social life and customs in the South Pacific Islands. It is entertaining and informative book to read. You will not regret it."
1390.5."Useful, witty and profound I have always loved Peter McWilliams poetry.He had the most impact on my style of writing poetry(Poems in the Key of Life...a Journey). I never knew he wrote non-fiction books. When I couldn't find his poetry books I came to Amazon to purchase them again. This is when I saw his non-fiction work. I bought one. I loved it. It is a useful guide how to go through life with less distress. He does it in a witty, amusing and easy to understand way. I think everyone should read his books. I plan on getting the rest of his work. I have no doubt I will enjoy them as much as I have this one."
1391.5."The most wonderful self awareness/psychology book. A must read. When I was a Senior in High School I took an AP Psychology class and the teacher used this book. This book has helped me so much in life. It helped me understand all those awkward teenage years. Helped me deal with an abusive, destructive blended family and helped me learn about myself and my own dysfunctionsd. This is a wonderful book that is very easy to read and something that every one should read."
1392.4."Everyone should read this book My high school teacher gave it to me as a gift over 10 years ago, I still find it fascinating and insightful. For people who like quotes about life, this is a must-have. It's an easy read for everyone, and makes you think. I definitely learned something about myself."
1393.1."Promising, but a let down. Sorry, i just didnt get it. We all know the lessons provided in this book. Seems too repetitive. There are plenty of other self help books that are more useful than this one."
1394.1."Simplistic, humorous book on life. This book really wasn't for me. It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre. Although, it might be useful to the right person. I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books. The book reads a lot like the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance. On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief."
1395.1."Total disappointment I was totally disappointed with the book for two reasons. One, it had a different author than the one I ordered. Two, it was tremendously boring. A waste of the little money I did spend to get it."
1396.2."A highly mixed blessing (?!) The quotes are wonderful, but the rest is an atrocity and an offense to the intellect of the reader with all the simplifications and self-pity. Please read some literature instead."
1397.2."It's never too late to write a ""self-improvement"" book Half the book (literally) is quotes. The rest, a bunch of touchy-feely, quite unmitigated flapdoodle. In my opinion, anyways. Considering how easily and cheaply quotation dictionaries can be had these days, I'd say, go to the source <g>, and just get one."
1398.5."Best band no one knows End of Romance is the great new album by one of the best rock and roll bands that no one has ever heard of. The album starts out with the rocking ""I'm No Angel"" which is a vastly different sound than anything on the band's previous works. The drum beat to this song will instantly have you pounding the dashboard in your car as you drive with the windows down and the stereo blasting. Other highlights include ""Walking Years Away"" and the best song on the album, ""Northstar"". The song ""Coping"" which was on the ""Born and Razed"" album makes an appearance in a different arrangement; one that gives the song a much harder edge, on this record. All in all ""End of Romance"" is a terrific rock and roll album and one that will hopefully garner the Charlie Mars Band the audience they deserve."
1399.1."HA! I know bad music when I hear it. Here 'tis. The lead singer is the main problem, the band are not too bad, just apparently under the leadership of this mo. Go back to mommy and daddy in TX."
1400.4."Working Jeans They are definitely a man's pair of jeans. Couldn't imagine they would be more stiff and plain then when I tried them on. Good working jeans now."
1401.4."Quick Service This style and the size my husband needs has not been available in our local stores. I was able to find what I needed quickly online and the shipping was very prompt. I would have given it five stars but he hasn't had time to try them on yet so I can't give a perfect score."
1402.1."Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs? I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!"
1403.1."Too short product & too bad shipping process I got the black stockings in size A/B. They are way off too short. Almost 1"" above my knees. I am 5'3"" and 125 lbs. Make sure you order at least one size up.I am also disappointed with the customer service. Shipping took exactly 2 weeks. I do not think I would like to order another thing from Essential Apparel."
1404.3."Nice thigh highs. I purchased these just to see what they would be like. They were perfectly nude and you truly couldn't tell I was wearing them. I think I may have preferred just a bit darker since my legs are light color but for the price, I'll keep them. The lace was pretty and they were very soft on the skin and to the touch."
1405.3."Upholds well Nice and sleek. Very sexy and they are run resistant. However, I did end up putting a hole in the lace but it did not effect the hose."
1406.3."Serviceable I got the black stockings in size A/B. I'm small, but they stay up fine. They're good, average stockings. If you're looking for the really silky kind that make people go ""ooh"" when they touch them, these are not it. But they're perfectly fine for everyday wear."
1407.5."Great Quality They were really soft and great quality. No defects (which is always nice lol). The fiance and I both loved them."
1408.5."A lingerie must-have I hate the modern day thigh highs with the silicone bands that hold them up on your thigh. These stockings do not have them in the lace trim. A garter belt is required or garter straps on your favorite bustier. Gives you that sexy garter style without the unsightly bulging and uncomfortable pinching."
1409.4."Almost perfect Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch, so if you have large thighs you might not like them. The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more."
1410.4."Lovely stockings To date these are my favorite stockings - absolutely beautiful lace top and a lovely hand to the leg. The lace is quite substantial though and with many of the tiny buttons on garter belts this can be a problem. If your thighs not thin, go up a size - I always have.However this is a fabulous stocking that fits, wears well, and feels very nice. THe black is a bit darker than I would prefer."
1411.1."Did not get what I ordered I just got these stockings but the seller sent me a way smaller size (A-B) than I ordered, I e-mailed them telling them about the problem and will keep you dear buyer posted. I cannot tell you about anything about the quality or color because I have not opened the ones I received."
1412.4."Good Golly It's Little Richard It's really Little Richard singing some great Little Richard tunes with all the ""woo!""s in the right places. But they're not the original recordings, and while still one hell of a singer and performer, the strain of time can be heard as he slowly but surely goes out of key toward the end of the recording. The back-up musicians don't seem to have quite the same energy as the original Disturbers, either. That all said, this is a nice collection of some of his best songs an the price is right."
1413.2."Not original hit versions, yet nowhere does jacket or CD say so I've owned this CD for a few years, yet thought something was slightly off, so I compared ""Keep A Knockin"" to another copy I have.Results:Original is 168 beats per minutes, while this version is 172 beats per minute.Original's time is 2 min. 23 seconds; this version is 2:16 min."
1414.4."I love this set! I purchased this set for myself, because I fell in love with the design. A piece was chipped in the first shipment, but Amazon sent me the replacement immediately. I appreciate their quick response. It might not be the ""every-day"" set, as it is rather fragile(otherwise, I'd rate it 5 stars), but the design is wonderful. A perfect gift!"
1415.5.Beautiful and arrived perfect! I have been wanting this pattern for some time now, so I finally ordered it (3 actually)and they just arrived, very well packed, not a scratch on them, and on time!And you can't beat the price from Amazon, I saved about $75 on each set!
1416.3."It's just okay These hooks could have stronger magnets. They look nice, and the size is adequate, but the magnets are barely strong enough to hold a pot holder. With a stronger magnet, these would be a great product. For now, meh."
1417.3."Not very strong Looks great but they will barely hold my set of keys (4 keys and a keyless entry) or a pot holder before they start to slide down my fridge. I thought the magnet on the back would be bigger...maybe I can replace it with my own."
1418.3."Good for holding small items, but the magnet is weak I use these hooks on the side of my fridge to hold my keys and lanyard for my job's ID badge and the hooks still slide a bit from the weight if I'm not painstakingly delicate. In the case of my key ring, this is particularly discouraging as the ring isn't loaded with the usual assortment of retail cards and/or gaudy key chains a lot of folks have; only two small keys and my car's door opener.I can't imagine these being viable for anything heavier than a small key ring or similarly light object as they're currently issued. Perhaps a trip to the hardware store is in order for some stronger magnets and adhesive. I do like the look of the hooks, especially against my brushed stainless steel fridge, but the magnets are simply too small and weak for most applications."
1419.5."Marshall Hollenzer is Driving This is a superbly written book. Witty, clever, and thought provoking, I found if hard to put down. It is filled with quirky and interesting characters, prose that flows, and subtle humor that occasionally had me laughing out loud. I cannot wait to read the next book by this promising young author."
1420.3."Slim Pretty good lyrics. Slim Thug sounds like he comes from that class of rappers under the Houston legend Big Love. That ESG cat has an irritating voice. Overall cool album."
1421.5."CAREFUL what you order It is a great tool and glad the manufacturer stands behind their products. They exchanged the Spanish for English. The tools is worth the money just make sure you get it in the correct language. I am just to OLD to learn a new language."
1422.3."Only for the scholar Theft of the Nation is a scholarly work. Does a very good job of describing the structure, hierarchy, operations of Organized Crime in America. However, the book was written over thirty years ago. I would only recommend this book to someone who was seriously in the study of crime, organized crime, law enforcement, etc... because it is rather dryly written."
1423.4."Caribes I haven't actually read Cienfuegos - yet. However, I purchased Caribes via the internet purely because I had been recommended the author and did not realize until I received it that it was the second of a series. Today I was looking for the third in the series - Azabache as I simply have to find out what happens to Cienfuegos next! Caribes is the first spanish book I have read cover to cover and I can't wait to get hold of the next . Great characterization. Vasquez - Figueroa certainly has a vivid imagination which constantly surprises you while instilling a sense of history about the conquest of the New World. Please, please please can Amazon get in ALL of the books in this series as well as Tuareg and Yaiza which I have also been highly recommended (untranslated)"
1424.3."Entertaining way to learn about the discovery of America I was given the whole Cienfuegos series (six books in total) as a Xmas present and I didn't stop until I read all of them. The plot is full of action and attractive characters and you learn a lot of History as you enjoy it. Vazquez Figueroa takes you on board the Santa Maria to discover the New World and feeds you with lots of true information about those first and critical years of conquest and colonization. I have not read other books by this author, but I am sure I will in the future. One thing I don't like, though, is the poor literary quality of the text (in the Spanish version). Sometimes you wonder how some of the more obvious mistakes went past all editing controls. Other than that, a wonderful read."
1425.2."What a disappointment! I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future."
1426.5."WONDERFUL Another Winner for Belva. The characters are real and you will both laugh and cry. The story is believable. You will not be able to put it down."
1427.1."Unbelievable I'll have to reserve a higher rating until I finish this saga. I think I will have to agree with the previous reviewer that gave a low rating. The dialog is so stilted I can't believe what I am reading. I AM a Belva Plain admirer, but her writing here leaves much to be desired.Back to this unbelievable couple and their disolving marriage."
1428.5."This book is a straight 5 starts!! I'm an avid reader of Belva Plain's books, and After The Fire is just another one of her masterpieces. I really don't understand how anyone who've read this book can think otherwise."
1429.2."Not my kind of book This is the first novel by Belva Plain I have read and I can say without hesitation it will be my last. I found the entire premise to be nothing short of silly (how many mothers would give up their children based on their supposed involvement in an accidental fire?) The plot was laughable and the main character pathetic. Sorry I wasted my time on this one."
1430.3."OK.... I used to read Belva Plain quite a bit; it's been a while...but I found this on my shelf. It was an ok read. Probably about as good as what her other books were, but I was in high school/college when I was reading them and tastes change.The premise was pretty interesting, but after a while Hyacinth, who is hiding a secret I won't spoil- starts to get on your nerves. Towards the end you're ready to yell at the novel to just get on with it!! I think the other thing that gave me mixed feelings with this book was that I really just didn't understand Hyacinth as a mother...I won't bore you with it, but I just didn't ""buy"" her as a loving mother.If you like Plain you might enjoy this book...other than that I really can't recommend it to anyone."
1431.4."A Good Read Hyacinth has met the love of her life, Gerald, a medical student who wants to marry her. She is sure that theirs will be a ""happily-ever-after"" marriage. Her mother warns her about things she has observed in Gerald, but Hyacinth, undaunted, proceeds with the wedding. As it turns out, Mother really does know best in this case but Hyacinth has to learn this the hard way. Gerald uses an unfortunate incident against Hyacinth and she loses everything that she loves. Eventually she finds her true niche in life through a man who loves her, but her secret past keeps her from marrying him. This is a good page-turner and one in which you do care about the main character."
1432.2."Plain disappointed I always read Belva Plain's new books since I have enjoyed her previous books very much. I found this book to be predictable from the onset. I looked at the front of the book twice to be sure I hadn't inadvertently grabbed a Danielle Steele book from the library shelves. The story line is a standard and I found nothing redeeming or unique in any of the characters. I didn't feel any empathy for Hyacinth's situation since it seemed totally unrealistic that she would have relinquished her children without resorting to every possible alternative. I am certain that Belva Plain will return to her previous writing style with her next book(s)...please."
1433.4."Mr & Mrs Who? I am well into the book and am enjoying it as I am a fan of Belva Plain. However, no where so far do I find the last name of Hyacinth's family or Gerald's family. They are Dr & Mrs Gerald Who? Am I missing something or was this intentional on the part of the author?"
1434.3."Good not great. Looks like OEM, but the fit wasn't quite as tight as the factory original but otherwise worked fine. Easy installation"
1435.2."Defective When I attempted to install the mirror onto my pickup, the three screws came unthreaded from the housing, which means that I cannot tighten the mirror to my pickup."
1436.3."Pretty good read...but take with a grain of salt The author relates actual events in Texas Ranger history as though he was present. However, the Texas State Historical site has no record of him ever being on Ranger rolls."
1437.4."Good period piece, taken with a grain of salt Interesting anecdotes of a white man living among the indians, the hardships and struggles, but it's obviously a biased tale. Quite a stretch for the reader to believe that a man- Texas Ranger no less- would be unable to ""escape"" before 3 years. Personally I don't believe it. Anyway, while one reviewer highlights a particular commanche torture to an infant, it's best to keep everything in perspective and acknowledge the extreme brutality whites displayed against all tribes in the western hemisphere- for example, Sand Creek, Wounded Knee. That said, if you like stories similar to this, try Nat Love's autobiography."
1438.4."Nice set Not top of the line, but adequate. Purchased for my son-in-law. He's happy with it to use with his woodburning stove in their first home. I would purchase it again."
1439.2."The paint cover is flammable Bought this set based on low price and good reviews. Works fine for poking logs occasionally and cleaning up when stove is cold, but while using the shovel in the fire, the black coating started bubbling, then caught fire."
1440.1."Lousy workmanship This product does its job, but not very well. All the end pieces, except the shovel, and the handles have to be attached to the rods. The poker, the main tool used, does not fit on the rod very well, and will spin loose when trying to move a log. My husband said he will weld it on so it won't move. Would recommend a different product, probably something that is constructed of one piece."
1441.3."you get what you pay for... This item ships slow and the quality is cheap. I dont see how it's triple plated? It's just cast iron.For the price it's not bad, but there are many others that look better for a little more money. It's just okay."
1442.3."Good set for the price... Only problem with it is that the big metal handles make it difficult to take in and out of the metal hooks that hold it on the stand."
1443.2."it works as intended... It does the job, yet most certainly strictly utilitarian. No frills. Not sure it will last long. Not in any manner decorative."
1444.5."Better than expected! For thirty bucks, I wasn't expecting much. After reading the reviews, I knew not to expect much. I went so far as to add J-B Weld to my order in anticipation of wobbly joints.I've used it on one fire so far, and I have no need for the J-B Weld yet. When assembling it, the threads all seemed to fit quite well--very snugly, tight, and firm. No wobble. Can't beat the value of these. And all it takes is to J-B weld if it ever starts to ""go cheap"" on me."
1445.1."Disappointing I purchased these fireplace tools with great anticipation of beautiful, warming fires. The tools are cheaply made and if you don't put them into the holder the right way they get stuck and it's difficult to remove the handle. Do not recommend."
1446.2."Works It was a bit confusing to assemble. Had to redo a few times before I got the right rods with the right utensils. In the end you get what you paid for - bottom of the line product for cheap."
1447.1."did not like This set is very small. Not happy at all. Bought it because other people gave good reviews. We have a wood burning stove. The poker is not long enough to safely move logs around."
1448.2."broken When the tool set arrived it was okay..smaller than I thought but mostly one of the tools was broken so it made the set not acceptable."
1449.2."You get what you pay for. I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now."
1450.4."About what I expected It was about everything I expected because I read the reviews first. I wanted something that would be very inexpensive, but would serve the purpose. So far I have no complaints I have had several fires in my fireplace and it has served the purpose for which it was intended quite well.Each piece is a good weight in your hand, the stand is a little unstable but I just set it close to the hearth wall and its ok.Overall I am very happy especially for the price I paid for it."
1451.3."Attractive, but not that sturdy This item is very attractive, but some of the components (like the small stand), are not very sturdy, hence the 3 stars. The shovel is sturdier than it looks, but I've been very annoyed by how easily knocked over the stand is! If the solid base were just a bit bigger, it would be PERFECT!"
1452.1."Disappointed I was disappointed in the CD because I am a fan of the trio and this one had too much input from other musicians. I guess I was looking for unadulterated Steve Newcomb (sp). My error."
1453.1."Wrong Country for the product Had to call the MFGR'er to be informaed that the model I was sent does not fit on any GOLF with US Specs,it was manufactured for the UK version of the Golf, which has less ""plumbing"" and emmission gadgetery.For my model, the only option is the replacement filter (square) that fits in the filter box."
1454.3."Worth the price This is a nicely designed, easy to manipulate, sim/tycoon game. The graphics are good, and it has a low learning curve. Of course, these kinds of games are not for people who like action or shooters, so just know that there are no real ""disasters"" or anything.I got tired of the limited number and type of items I could place, and would have liked to have seen a sort of ""shop generator"" or something to really customize it. You can't even change the colors on the buildings to create a theme or atmosphere.Overall, though, it is worth the price, and will provide you with several hours of enjoyment. It is fun to go back to after you have sort of played it out, and just see what kinds of layouts you can create.Happy gaming!"
1455.2."Failed to Work I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response."
1456.5."This is what a management game should be! Virtual Resort: Spring Break is a highly addictive, surprisingly humorous management game with detailed graphics. True, you will need a powerful computer to get it to run smoothly, but when it does it is well worth it. It requires a decent amount of thinking and rewards you with entertaining animations. Being able to import your own music is a great feature. The level of control that is involved is what makes the game so addictive. It is actually entertaining to sit back and watch all the little things that are going on on your island. All other management games should strive to be half as fun as this one."
1457.3."Break Almost like gimme a break, theres no additions, extra downloads. Started to get a little bored. It's now in the back of my closet!!"
1458.5."An adult sim I have enjoyed this game. It seems easy but you'll find yourself out of time or money before you have met your objectives. You don't feel cheated, it makes you want try again and again. Maybe no one will drown and perhaps you can even turn a profit. I'm looking forward to many hours of entertainment."
1459.5."Great Music--Fun Game I loved the music for this game and the 20 bucks i spent on this thing when i bought a few years ago was well spent. Its the oldest game for my computer that i still play, probably because there are no sequels, but i burnt the music to a cd and can listen to it in my car. For the 3.50 the game is going at now you might as well just buy it to try it, then again you have to factor in shipping cost, but all in all a great game especially for under ten dollars."
1460.3."Very good concept... This is a great game, with a great concept and fun graphics. Unfortunately, the game shudders every two minutes of gameplay so I am forced to change the screen resolution of the game. This happens on my brand new laptop, while on my home computer it works perfectly."
1461.2."Spring Break - a lot of fun without the sunburn! My favorite game was roller coaster tycoon, until this one came along. I downloaded the demo and bought the full game on the same day. Spring break is great fun."
1462.2."Not my type.. Pros and cons of the game...Pros:*Great plot,U have to become the best chef and beat the evil omni food empire.*Quite fun since u are able to join cooking competitions*U feel a sense of sastification when u watch people dine in ur restaurant.CONS:*GRaphics are a boo-boo,the graphics was blur*There aren't there many furniture to choose from unlike the sims.*VEry limited control-all u do is watch ur customers eat.At first,u will feell very sastified....but after a while u become very bored.U just wait for people to enter the restaurant and buy recipes from them.I really wouldn't recommend this game beacuse i had very limited control over the restaurant.....All i did was sit and watch the customers dine.....Now how much of a game is that?!I got sick and tired of it after two days of playing."
1463.5."BB's the Best! It doesn't matter what this Master sings; he is the best. I have been a fan of BB's forever. There is no such thing as a bad BB collection of songs."
1464.3."Left wanting I gave this book a 3 only because it held me from start to finish, but few of the main characters were believable from beginning to end so I couldn't give it a 4 or 5. Things went from just plain ""bad"" to ""evil"" way to fast and the actions of Travis towards the end of the book were just too far out of character from how he was portrayed in the beginning. I couldn't buy a 12 year old doing what he did. I certainly did not put this book down and think ""good read"". More like ""well - that was disturbing"". Still - the author kept me hooked until 1am, so he gets a 3 for keeping me up way past my bedtime!"
1465.3."Very disturbing novel I was told about this writer by a friend of his. I was expecting a lot from his book, but I found it to be very disturbing. Aunt Delia was a sick character and I didn't feel this was a ""coming of age"" story, but a twisted one. The writing was from Travis' point of view, but still seemed a bit simplistic. I haven't read any other novels by this author, but I hope this is not his usual subject matter. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends. I finished this book with the same feeling I had when I saw the movie ""Deliverance""."
1466.4."SWEET DREAM BABY: Faux-Faulkner in Florida SWEET DREAM BABY isn't grand fiction, but it's an engrossing story with a vivid sense of time and place. The author has pulled off the difficult trick of showing the world through a child's eyes and yet supplying the reader with adult perceptions. Parts of the plot are predictable, but at the conclusion predictibility flies out the window. The novel may be set in the '50s, but this is not a Leave-it-to-Beaver ending.Anyone with firsthand experience of the fifties may have to stretch their suspension of disbelief regarding certain sexual behaviors by the protagonist's aunt in relation to her nephew, but the author has traded a bit of unlikeliness for a gimmick that elevates this novel from the usual coming of age story."
1467.5."How to Own Your Home Years Sooner- without making extra inte This book should wake up more people to the opportunity to manage and take control of their mortgage instead of the bank controling you. Good information, outlined well with easiy to understand examples.As and extra bonus it was great to meet the author Harj Gill the other night as he presented his information and also showed how to apply this knowledge to your business too.Look for this book to make a difference in banking here in the U.S."
1468.1."Mathematical nonsense Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice."
1469.2."A verbose informercial This entire book could be summed up in 10 pages. It is terribly repetitive. The basic premise is that one can use a HELOC instead of a Checking Account so that your money doesn't sit around idle while mortgage interest is accruing. This may have some merit, but it is not clear how much of the savings is due to putting all of your disposable income towards your mortgage. The big trade off is a loss of liquidity. I have been aware of this strategy for a while, and I hoped that this book would help to prove its effectivness, and explain exactly how to do it. It falls short. After reading numerous message boards on the subject, this book tought me nothing new. It really feels like an informercial that I paid for."
1470.5."What an Eye-Opener! When you understand that banks are interested in making money -- LOTS of it -- for themselves, you'll understand why this book was written. It helps you keep more of your money while still paying off what you borrowed, only faster.For a conventional mortage, most of the payments in the first few years go primarily to paying the interest on the loan, with very little going to the principal. With most people moving to a new one (trading up) every 5-7 years, they wind up paying LOTS of interest with very little to show for it. The banks get VERY rich this way.With this book, you can learn how to move out of that pool of quicksand and stand on solid financial ground. Harj writes clearly and simply without talking down to you. He lays it all out from beginning to end, and everywhere in between.More than worth the INVESTMENT in your life. Definitely read it."
1471.2."Boring ... I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time."
1472.2."Stuck With You I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book, there would not have been much to write about. What happened with Nick and the law suit. It was barely mentioned. She could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex."
1473.2."Harlequin Romance in sheep's clothing Pretty much just a business woman's Harlequin Romance.Sex scenes in a book cover you're not 100% embarrassed to be seen reading in public."
1474.1."Too blunt for me! All I can really say is I didn't even finish the book. I love romances but this one wasn't for me. I found it too much to read about sexual desire and how the body responds to it, that was too much for me. I would say this book should say blush or some kind of note to let people know its not clean romance."
1475.1."Don't Bother This was a free kindle purchase. I guess you get what you pay for with the Kindle.This was absolute drivel! This writer neither knows southerners nor humour. The story was so unbelievable, it was laughable. Could not finish this pile of ..."
1476.5."Love this story. Well written I love this story. Loaned it to my sister and she was just as impressed as I was. Highly recommended."
1477.3."A pastime .. Even thou the situation is a ""little"" unbeliavable, it was a fun read. He is a lovable character. You'll finish the book with s smile."
1478.3."Not for sharing with your teenagers A very superficial romance novel with lots of good humor and insight into the legal issues of divorce and family relationships..OK to read on the beach!"
1479.3."Funny but... I enjoyed his book. It was funny although a bit too much one liners. I did however DISLIKE the comparison of one of the characters looking at another like ""an Ethiopian child looks at a seven course feast"" or something like that. Really? There is NOTHING even REMOTELY funny about a STARVING CHILD!!! Although I managed to finish the book, and enjoyed other aspects of it, that one line stayed in the back of my mind. :("
1480.3."Kind of simple It held my interest and had a few entertaining moments. Paige's family was more interesting than she was. Her brother and Rachel kind of got shorted in the plot development area. Their story seemed to be paralleling Ross and Paige then suddenly they all but disappeared--too bad.The main plot point with the quarantine was a bit too unbelievable. It was a different twist on throwing two very mismatched people together for a long period of time, but it had a lot of holes in it. I liked Ross, although at times he seemed a bit too perfect, but Paige needed someone to grab her by the shoulders, shake her hard, and tell her to get over herself."
1481.1."Total Garbage!! I got this book free for my Kindle. I have read a lot of free Kindle books and most of them are not that great, but they are at least a little entertaining. This is the first book I have deleted before finishing it. I read to 35% and just could not take any more! It was not funny at all, it was super annoying and predictable."
1482.2."Boring Maybe my expectations are too high but after reading the reviews I expected more. I thought the plot was too unrealistic for me to even be interested in. I liked the characters but I found myself flipping through pages just to get through the book."
1483.2."The writing is good, but the plot needs a lot of work. I love books that make me laugh, and a friend told me about this book. I paid full price, and I feel somewhat had. Ms. Jensen has a gift for humor, but the plotting involved in this book is horrible. Good humor has to have some element of believability in it, and this book has none whatsoever. With a believable story line, Ms. Jensen could be among the top humor writers out there."
1484.4."Love Bug Virus versus the real thing - LOVE! Need a fun ""pick-me upper"" for a quick read- try this one. Paige is a tax lawyer handling a cousin's divorce case while Ross is a divorce lawyer handling the cousin's spouse's side of the case. They can't stand each other- until they are forced to spend unlimited time for 2 weeks quarentined together in a hospital due to being exposed to a virus. Virus - The LoveBug! Lots of passion- due to the virus or could it be love?"
1485.4."Stuck With You If you are looking for a humorous, contemporary romantic novel 'Stuck With You' is the book for you. The characters are well developed; even the secondary ones are very humorous. It had me laughing out loud in parts. Although the plot is a little over the top, it is great fun and very easy to read; perfect for unwinding after a hard day."
1486.3."eh........ ""Stuck With You"" was o.k. The idea for the story was a cute one, but I thought that the characters were woefully underdeveloped and some of the dialogue and situations were so cheesy I couldnt help but cringe. This is the only book that I have ever experienced by this author, and while I wont say it was awful, I will say that it just wasnt for me. Mediocre at best."
1487.3."Middle of the road Ms. Jensen has tried to write an interesting story. Unfortunately I was not able to suspend myself from reality far enough to accept the premise of these being the only two people exposed to a possible virus. What about the EMT's and people in the emergency room? And there was ONLY one room to keep a man and a woman in? I can only give this book a mediocre rating for a mediocre story. :-("
1488.3."A enjoyable read but not quite .... The story started off with great promise. From the beginning we have interesting characters in a situation if not exactly plausible then almost believable. The situation of the forced isolation was comedic with the potential to for a lot of development of the main characters. Instead the author used some of this time to develop an sub-story among secondary characters. While I enjoyed this secondary sub-story and the host of interesting other characters in the story I came away feeling that the main characters story was always rushed when the focus of the story returned to them."
1489.3."Bought on Kindle I saw the cover and was drawn in (I usually pick books based on the cover-not sure why). Anyways, it was a cute book and a very quick read. Not sure if it would be something I would recommend. I got it for a great price on Kindle, so I could not pass up Chick Lit."
1490.3."A bit predictable, but a fun read This was certainly a fun read, but a little on the silly side. The ""virus"" that they were possibly infected with seemed a bit of a stretch, but a cute read non-the-less."
1491.1."Too old to matter This book really should be removed from circulation. While basic MIDI information is in there, it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read. Examples are of obsolete or vintage gear and has no real relation to todays musician.Illustrations are all cheesy and look like bad microsoft clipart. Photographs are all poor and dated. The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere. If you are trying to get information on MIDI in the last decade or so, buy a different book."
1492.2."Somewhat outdated This book was published in 1987 and reprinted in 1994. The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC. I do think this was an excellent book in 1987, but digital music has moved on a long way since then."
1493.3."Beautiful, but a let down The music is absolutely beautiful , It is sung by Maaya. the let down is that there are only four tracks though two songs ('I am a Dreamer' and '24') sung by Maaya and the other two without Maaya, besides that its okay!"
1494.2."Hmmm. Well, I guess if you've never heard this kind of stuff before then it's fine, but it certainly is not the future of music. Listen to Papalotl instead."
1495.4."A very good resource book for ERP professionals As the title sounds, the author explained very well about the integration issues that companies who are aiming to become World Class Manufacturing companies status should look into. I stongly suggest those professionals who are being involved in the ERP business to read this book. Flow chart diagrams represent the best way to describe the integration processes among functional areas."
1496.2."very cheaply made I just received this today and while I knew to expect nothing hand crafted, I was shocked at how amazingly flimsy this thing really is. The bottom wood actually came with a huge crack; big enough to leak out all the sand. The feet were glued on with cheap glue and 3 of the 4 came off in transit. Based on the construction, I'm amazed it was even in one piece.The reason this gets 2 stars is that the accessories are pretty decent. And the sand looks fine. If this wasn't cracked in the center, I'd most likely have kept it and it would have ""worked"" for its purpose. Having said that, if you are looking for a desktop zen garden, look elsewhere."
1497.2."Read the reviews first! I bought this on a whim, as it was the first Zen garden that I could find. I did not look at the reviews, and immediately regret it upon receiving my Zen garden. The other reviews summed it up nicely. The product is exactly what you pay for.Image:[...] - You can see the gap between the border/frame and the bottom piece. The tacks were put in, but did not hold the board to the border/frame. You should probably buy some wood glue, push lightly to separate the border, then press it back together with a small vice."
1498.3."Great Idea, Flimsy construction I loved it when it got here. It looked nice and was very relaxing to use. The meditation book was a wonderful addition! Unfortunately the box is not sealed closed and sand is constantly escaping from the bottom. (not huge drifts, but little trickles). Overall, not the best made product."
1499.2."Cheap, and it shows The product looks really nice when you open it. But when I took the zen garden out of the box, I discovered that two of the four feet had come off, and that the bottom was only attached to the sides in four places, at the corners. Along all four sides, it was bowed out with loads of space.I pushed it all together and glued the feet back on, but I'm keeping this in the bottom of the box it shipped in, lest I end up with fine white sand all over my desk. (I have this item at work.) When I leave the job or change work areas, I think I'll toss this rather than trying to bring it with me.Otherwise, it works as advertised. Really, it's hard not to, as it's sand and rocks in a tray. It's just hard to believe that a tray you put sand in could have been screwed up this way."
1500.3."it serves it's purpose.... It' s smaller than I expected which seems to be a common theme throughout the reviews. Not very durable...it needs to be deeper, very hard to rake and not get sand everywhere."
1501.5."stress reliever Co-workers stop to comb the sand and ask where I got it. Its a great time out in a stressful environment."
1502.3."Fell apart When I opened the box and took out the item, the frame fell apart. I like the size and looks of the item, so I decided to keep it and glue it back together. It is very cheaply made."
1503.2."Soothing Creates a big mess. It's also pretty small so it gets very boring after a while. I've had it for like 6 months and used it twice. and that was the first week i got it."
1504.4."Great desk item This item is great for sitting on a desk top in an office, classroom, etc. It arrived quickly and seems to be good quality for the price."
1505.1."very poor construction For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen."
1506.4."Exactly What I Wanted I bought this gift for my boyfriend who is going into law school. It was partly a gag gift, but I really did think he could use it to relax when he gets overly stressed. He already loves it and has used it a ton. I love that there are two rakes, and the rocks are appropriate for the size of the garden. There is quite a bite of sand, and it does spill over the edges a little bit when you are using it, but it isn't a huge deal. I can see where other people might have had problems with the base, but this one is just fine and there have been no leakages. I also love the size of this one because it is large enough that you can make great designs in the sand. I had considered going with something smaller, but now I'm glad I didn't because I don't think it would have nearly as much fun or relaxing. I definitely would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple gift that everyone can enjoy."
1507.5."Great for office I purchased this for my new office and I love it and so does everyone who comes in."
1508.2."broken :( The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that."
1509.4."Nice but Watch Out! Once I shook it a little to make it the sand flat, sand started pouring out the bottom sides because the bottom wood had pulled away from the tacks or nails. I poured the sand back into the packaging box for safekeeping and took the box home for repairs (I bought it for my office). I still like this item; the size is perfect, the sand is nice and plentiful and the rocks are nice river rocks, not too shiny or too dull. I didn't expect much because of the price so I'm actually happy with it... I dropped a star because of the repairs I had to make. I just wish I had read all the reviews before pouring the sand in and making a mess!"
1510.3."Great, but not so great It came exactly as stated, except all four legs were off by the time I got it. I would have just glued them back on, but one was missing totally.Otherwise this is an excellent give. He loved it and ""plays"" with it daily."
1511.4."Oddly, this works. If you stop, take a deep breath and move the sand & stones it is relaxing.It is not an immediate fix and it requires you to work at shutting out everything else.If you do that, this will relax you.Additionally, you can make some nice designs."
1512.2."poor quality Disappointed in this item. The tray bottom was not attached well to the sides - doesn't hold the sand. Also, the rocks are dull and all one color. Rakes seem to be OK."
1513.2."for your own sake, do not buy!!! When i got my package i openned it and everything was great, but the sand holder is so cheaply made, it was broken before i even touched it. Now i have to go through the hassle of finding the right one maybe at a home goods store.. and there is no way you can have a refund which i wanted, because they take off the sticker you use to send it back. I basically paid for sand rocks, and a cheap rake. Not worth the money! Made in china, the table is not stable at all. I hope nobody buys this, because they certainly dont deserve the money. Quality over quantity. -Rant over-"
1514.2."Not so thrilled The tray was thin and cheap looking and although it was supposed to have rocks included, there were none in the box. The only part of it that was half-way decent was the rakes. Because I was on a time constraint I kept it, but I did have to go buy rocks and I also bought more sand because what came with it looked like salt."
1515.2."Short good text, overwhelming background noise and old film. These two short tapes consist of a brief description of 50 years of white-red relations, treaties and conflicts. Because of its brevity, there is little detail presented. The text is interesting and appears to be factually correct. The presentation is relatively unbiased, and is quite interesting. It would make a good audio tape. The extra loud background music and simulated battlefield noise sometimes drowns out the text. The visual portion consists of old photographs, presumably authentic in detail and clips from old grade B movies which are quite far from authentic. These are rerun from 6 to 10 times throughout the presentation and, of course, have no bearing on the text. Except for the extreme brevity and the overwhelming background noise, one can ignore the visual effects and derive a worthwhile understanding of many aspects of the period of the Indian Wars."
1516.1."do not buy this piece of c--p do not buy The Great Indian Wars. the same hollywood movie stock played over and over, sometimes without even turning down the borrowed movie's audio. i couldn't concentrate on the narration, and that was a shame because the narration was very well written. the narrator also had a fine voice and read his stuff superbly. i felt sorry for him, being assocaited with something that went so bad through no fault of his own. someone ruined this ""documentary"" with the choice and use of the visual footage.i even tried turning off the picture and listening only to the narration but the silly dialogue and old-western music score made trying to listen only to the narrator sheer torture. i only wish i could have given this film a rating it really deserves. MINUS FIVE! the fact that they used 2 tapes when the entire length is only 96 minutes proves to me that the intent of the producers was only to flim-flam the public into thinking they were getting a lot for their money."
1517.1."The Great Indian Wars 1840-1890 This is without a doubt the worst video I have ever watched.The videos picture could not tracted without jumping lines and wiggling screen it was painful for me to watch.The movie itself was out of focus.They used old black and white movies"" indians meet the cavalry "" to illustrate the action and pencil drawings of the indian chiefs while they spoke of them. There was one man speaking with a monotone voice.After five minutes it became very boring to watch.The movie was put together very poorly and hard to watch the pictures had very little contrast, and hard listen to.It was so bad I could'nt retain any of infomation,my mind kept wandering off. If you enjoy being bored,and having your ears and eyes assulted by this low grade quality picture this movie is for you. Reviewed by Paul Phillips"
1518.2."You get what you pay for I guess. This radiator seems to be very cheaply built. Its aluminum and plastic! It did not even come with a radiator cap. How cheap can you get?"
1519.5."a welcome return to form I want to second everything said by Mr. Grimlan with respect to this album and Les Baxter's output in general. Although I am extremely fond of Les's 1940s-50s work in all genres, some of his 60s pop things (specifically, VOICES IN RHYTHM and COLORS OF BRAZIL/AFRICAN BLUE) continue to leave me cold. This 1970 album, however, exhibits none of the shortcomings of those earlier ones - the lukewarm performances, the generic guitar/bass work or the uncomfortably passe doo-wahs. No, this abbreviated QUE MANGO! has real energy. It crackles - and not only is there not a bad track, but some of them (""Que Mango"", ""Tropicando"", ""On a Warm Night"", ""Felicia, My Love"") stand easily with the best of Les's work from his great 50s albums. Highly recommended even as it is at under 24 minutes."
1520.1."Not working correctly I purchased this a month ago and found out this was not working correctly.I had it pugged in and it went on by itself, then another time I could not control it with the remote....Not happy in Lynn, Mass"
1521.2.NO GOOD Bought this for the Christmas lights 1 for outside and one for the tree,works great EVEN WITH EVERY OTHER REMOTE YOU HAVE WILL TURN IT ON OR OFF,AND DRIVE YOU CRAZY!!!!THE CAR REMOTE/ GARAGE/ HANDY SWITCHES ALL TURNED THE LIGHTS ON
1522.4."Tequila a mexican treasure If you ever wonder how tequila is made, find out what an amazing process it is. Buy this book.Full of incredible rich photographs, that depict the everyday beauty of Mexico."
1523.3."Had great potential There's no doubt the authors know their subject. Sadly where this falls short is the lack of a good editor to massage the text into greatness. If you appreciate good tequila, this is well worth reading--great history and background on the region. It's a shame they missed the opportunity for creating the definitive book on the subject. Better editing and good photography would have made this a 5-star book. Still, it's a lot better than the other pithy books on tequila with froufrou recipes and questionable history."
1524.5."YEB! Nab tis iz e bok. I'v beeen dwinkinking teakilyafar sum time and I cun say itz the bast dwink tohavb! Nah I meen et! I'b no dares Beer and Wienbat nothfing beets Teequilla,NOFING!

1525.1."Not happy with seller I ordered and paid for an 8 ounce product and received a 4 ounce product. Now the seller wants me to take a picture of the product and the bar code and send it to them before they will make good on it. I've ordered from them before and there have been issues. Never again....What a pain."
1526.5."BEWARE! In this book Agatha Christie refers to the murderers in Death in the Clouds, the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Mysterious Affair at Style and the Mystery of the Blue Train, so make sure you have read all of these before you read this one, our your fun will be spoilt!Dumb Witness is one my top ten favourite Agatha Christie novels. Dame Christie has expressed the character of Hastings better here than in any of the other seven novels in which he appears. It is also one of the most amusing.One thing I enjoy about this book is that we are given a fair crack at the whip - everything that Poirot sees we see, there are no last minute envelopes arriving (which often irritates me). His explanation is convincing.Go ahead and read it! But don't forget to read the books mentioned above first."
1527.3."good... This a good book, but not that great. An old woman writes to Poirot, informing him that she fears that one of her own family may murder, one attempt had all ready been made. But the lady is delayed, and when Poirot arrives on the scene, the woman is dead. Who did it? This plot wiil keep you reading till the end."
1528.4."An average Poirot book, plus a dog! I am a Poirot fan, so I enjoyed this mystery as I expected. The little dog in the story is precious and adds a new element to the plot. I don't remember an animal being featured this way in another Christie book. While I was reading, I kept thinking that the plot reminded me of another Christie book but couldn't remember which one. I thought I had guessed the killer but I was wrong. Which makes me like it more!"
1529.4."Great fun! The Dumb Witness of the title is a dog named Bob. A dog who loves his mistress and possibly is the only witness to her murder. If it was a murder ... Hastings and Poirot work together, trade quips and get on one another's nerves as they work through a neat collection of suspects. This isn't high art, but it is quaint and well crafted. I recommend it."
1530.3."Not the definitive work on 1911's... Quite honestly I found this book mediocre at best. It's something of a ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" effort. If you're a big 1911 fan then you might consider this book, but if you're not, spend your money elsewhere. One good point, there are detailed examinations of 23 different kinds of 1911 pistols which is great if you want an STI or an Auto Ordnance, but where are the various Colt models in detail?"
1531.2."Not a ""Bible"" by any means whatsoever This book says it is a ""look"" and that what it is. By no means is it the Bible or even a beginner's guide to the 1911. Half the book is just gun reviews, which you can get anywhere. Another 1/4 or more has to do with competitions and things like that. If you want to learn about the ""use, care, and maintenance"" of the 1911, look elsewhere. The internet is better than this book."
1532.2."Left me feeling wanting......... Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it. He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines?"
1533.4."This book is great Buy this to learn more about your 1911 pistol. I really followed some things written here and presto!, My gun worked better. (with the help of my gunsmith)Knowing your pistol can save your life and money. And knowing your pistol means that it is safer to handle and carry."
1534.5."Model 1911 Lovers An excellent addition to the library of any Model 1911 owner. The book deals with the history, shooting and maintenance of this iconic firearm."
1535.3."The sequel was actually better This book is a solid ""okay"". The Volume 2, however, was vastly more interesting to me. Still, not a bad addition to any 1911 afficianado's bookshelf."
1536.3."Book is good Good book on care and maintenance of the 1911, found it useful and being a 1911 fan, it deserves a place in my private library."
1537.1."Flimsy materials, potentially dangerous item Even though this is rated to hold up to 2000 lbs. I would not trust it to last very long. The nylon and ropes that this comes with are clearly very low quality. Some of the ropes even showed signs of fraying straight out of box. Cannot recommend this item."
1538.4."Good for kids with sensory issues We got this for our son with sensory issues as an alternative to a more expensive therapy swing. If you use it without the cupholder and foot rest, it works just fine, and since it's hanging inside, we don't worry about wear and tear. Just make sure you have a swivel joint at the ceiling for it.Hanging in a kids room, it will generally fall very close to the ground, so be sure to shorten the cord to a higher level for a taller child."
1539.5."Greatest Box Set Ever !! This box set is a MUST-HAVE for all Elvis/Orion fans alike. Booklet is fantastic. Songs are great . Can't wait till the next Orion box set !"
1540.2."Wabash 1938 This trilley has been opersted only a few hours and the drive system seems to be slipping already. Not durable and not recommended."
1541.3."Good Remote Control Features This is a good general-purpose tripod for Sony Handicams. The remote control handle is a must-have feature for decent videos. With practice, slow zooms are possible.My biggest complaint is that the unit does not have a fluid head. It can be hard to get smooth pans without some jerkiness.However, the overall features and utility of the remote handle and a reasonable price, make this a good buy."
1542.5."great to use with action shots or beginning photographers im glad i bought this item i could have use this years ago as i love to take pictures and video my kids sports.Darrin & Jackie"
1543.5."Nolde Ignites Passion I'm an always learning watercolorist and this book is great inspiration for letting more passion flow into my everyday and my art. the book arrived in 'very good' condition, as requested. Nolde's landscapes and flowers are unparalleled in their joy for color and sense of spontaneous energy and expression. i'm really glad i did the market buy and let Amazon find the book over a few months."
1544.2."A padded short story disguised as a literary novel The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not. Dickens, Poe, even Highsmith have succeeded much better in what Trevor seeks to achieve."
1545.2."Good basic story, but many flaws I found the basic idea of the book to be excellent and very true to life, however, I cannot say the same for the characters, Felicia in particular. Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ...The character of Mr. Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character. I felt that too much of the book (one quarter) was devoted to Mr. Hilditch's downward spiral. It almost becomes a completely different story.As a previous reviewer mentioned, the author's practice on going back and the forth between past and present was confusing."
1546.4."Darkly Poetic- No Wonder Ireland has had 4 Nobel Laureates in Literature This book deatails the travels of Felicia, a young Irish girl, who finds herself pregnant by a rake and travels to England to find him. We know from the beginning that she is on a fruitless task - she has been used, abused and discarded. On her search, she is 'befriended' by a creepy man who portends trouble and worse for Felicia. The book is peopled by religious fanatics, homeless eccentridw who come alive during the night and it is always surprising to recognize the naivity and innocence of Felicia. Despite the horrors and depravity that the book allude to, Trevor never gets into the bloody details that an author such as Stephen King savors. The same monstrosities are here but they are alluded to and left to our imagination, our ability to call forth our own personal monsters and give them literary life."
1547.5."Arrived in great Book looks great everything that was promised and arrived in great time too. Thanks! Will enjoy reading it and sharing"
1548.4."a page turner that leaves an impression on your heart Trevor does an execptional job of captivating the reader and telling the story from the two main characters (Felicia and Hilditch). One cannot help but feel sad after reading this novel. All involved appear to be victims at various times and on various levels. Felicia, the victim of death (her mothers) and a jilted lover and Hilditch. Hilditch a victim of his mother and his need for ""friendship"".Trevor will keep you reading and feeling throughout the book. Do not expect to feel good after reading this novel. A great book for a book group discussion."
1549.4."A difficult read...but a great book I found this book to be a bit difficult to read because of the author's habit of jumping from past to present with no warning at all. I did however find the book to be very exciting and have not been able to get it out of my mind since I finished it.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a suspence and is looking for a change of pace. My only recommendation is to read it slowly to keep from getting confused!"
1550.5."Excellent software, but NOT an audio CD Amazon needs to fix its info for this product - it's not an audio CD. It's a great package of software that has helped me bulk up my vocabulary and get a better pronuncation in modern standard arabic. I learned arabic grammar a while back, but found that its hard to communicate without a growing base of vocabulary to use. THis program is helping me do that. Love the clear audio recordings!"
1551.3."A disappointingly simple tool This is a decent tool for lower-intermediate Arabic students. It's basically just a series of vocab lists, sorted by theme. You can scroll through the lists in English, Arabic, or transliteration, and there are good audio recordings of the pronunciation of every piece of vocab. Also, there are notes on some of the words that provide a deeper understanding of their meaning and usage, e.g. proverbs or common phrases that contain the words.The frustrating thing is that there's not really a way to tag the words you know and pare the lists down to the ones you don't know, and there are no drills or quizzes built into the software. You also can't build your own lists, of either additional vocab or of selected tough words from the existing lists. So an application like RapidRote with built-in quiz functionality and with the ability to create your own lists is a little bit better.I would love to see these folks add some more features and flexibility to the next version."
1552.5."sorta wonderful this is what wilco would sound like now if they had not turned into radiohead. first 6 songs are as strong as any record in the last 10 years."
1553.5."The BEST PUR cd. A must have for any PUR fan, it is if full of classic songs such as ""Lena"", ""Prinzessin"" and ""Drachen sollen fleigen"". Great cd."
1554.3."Sizeable and sloppy The mug's pretty enough, despite a visible vertical seam from production. No insulation for hot drinks, so watch your hands and don't nurse too long. The outturned edge may cause some dribbling, but mine has carried me through dozens of winter nights and summer sunbathes. Brings out the beauty in iced tea."
1555.3."These break too easily I fell in love with these mugs as soon as I saw them, but it was short lived. I got 6 of them and 1 was broken when I received the box, and since I got them a short time ago 3 of them have cracked. they look really thick and durable, but they don't last long. I am very disappointed."
1556.1."ripped off was very upset that this DVD did not specify that you could not play it in the United States. Why was it on Amazon, USA. False Will not deal with this vendor ever again and will make sure my friends and colleagues are aware of it.."
1557.5."A timeless and memorable anthology Compiled and edited by William F. Buckiley, Jr., the Treasury Of Classic Children's Literature is an anthology of enduring stories for young folk, painstakingly selected and compiled by William F. Buckley, Jr. for their lasting appeal across the generations. Works by Jack London, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, Thorton W. Burgess, Palmer Cox, and others, are embellished with black-and-white illustrations in this timeless and memorable anthology which is a welcome and recommended addition to school and community library Children's Literature anthology collections."
1558.1."Don't like it I bought the Soyo 24 inch monitor based on a $100 reduction in price at Office Max and what appeared to be a review on the internet. Previously I had a Viewsonic 17"" LCD monitor which was pretty bad too. The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable, but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book. The User's manual is nearly incomprehensible. The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I've ever heard. I am going to repack and try to return it and buy something better ever if I have to pay more."
1559.4."LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing."
1560.2."The worst of all the Future sounds of jazz series... this all sounds crappy. fauna flash's drum n bass tune sounds so generic and boring that it makes everything else look bad. the tunes here are not of the same quality of other cds in the series like vol.5. i say skip this one, its really boring and with the exception of like one song by tosca everything else is $hit."
1561.5."CUT IT UP DEF IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT."
1562.5.Paperweight I purchase this for a friend who is a big fan of super girl she was really impress with the details lived it
1563.3."Nice But..... This is a good idea but what you cant really tell from the pictures is that the only puzzle part of the contraption (for lack of a better word) is the string with the rings. I thought the whole thing was a puzzle like the old iron ones I used to have. Good idea but if you want something that will really puzzle them I would go for a different model. On the plus side it looked really nice when we brought it to dinner and put it on the table and the perplexed look on our friends faces were great!"
1564.5."Excellent idea, went over perfectly at Christmas This gift for my brother at Christmas got more attention than any others. My sister and I hid upstairs for a good 20 minutes trying to get it together, which for us was fun. ""No, that doesn't look like the box. Let me try."" ""Maybe the German instructions make more sense"" (neither of us read German).Our time was well-spent: my brother and his girlfriend admired the appearance, loved the caddy, until my brother became suspicious and announced ""I think it's locked in"". As my sister and I sat smug, several people gave it a try, and we heard a resounding chorus of ""I know some people who absolutely must have this."""
1565.1."I do not recommend this vacuum We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner."
1566.4."Classic New Age Disc! Wow, I'm surprised to see this available here. Horizont's ""Silent Moon"" is a classic New Age album from 1986. It was readily available for a few years, then totally disappeared; this disc is EXTREMELY hard to find now. This album is a good mix of new age and ""space jazz"". Most of the synths used here are now obsolete, and they sound great. The title track is definitely the outstanding track on the disc, but others are great as well. If you were to compare to other artists, it would be kind of like combining Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, and Dave Grusin (the more jazzy tracks are Grusin-esque). Overall a good listen and a great representation of the greatest era in new age music. Too bad the cover art is not available here, it's awesome. If I get a chance I will scan my copy and post it. Grab this while you can, you may not see it again for a long long time."
1567.5."Imagine a cross between Tom Clancy and Tom McGuane A simple premise ... a wealthy American businessman's only granddaugter dies of a cocaine overdose. He decides that he's going to kill everyone who had anything to do with it, starting with her boyfriend and ending with the head of the Columbian drug cartel. Along the way yachts are wrecked and burned, secret love affairs are revealed, priests are consulted, and plenty of smartass dialogue is emitted. Buckley obviously knows what really rich people are really like, and in addition to having a great plot and memorable charactes, it's full of consistently interesting observations. A good book"
1568.3."Unfortunately - mediocre I bought this book to see if my fond memories of C. Buckley which were jolted by his latest effort ""Supreme Courtship"" could be calmed and massaged.This book started out like a fine walk in the woods and then got into somewhat muddy grounds and then a bit swampy and finally quicksand. Sorry. Three stars is the best I can do and I don't even feel that I want to justify it."
1569.4."Wolverine Anime Fans of American Wolverine must remember this is an anime not a Marvel Comics release. I will admit the voice of Wolverine is a little unexpected being not nearly as gruff and deep as what we have came to know. Also, yes He looks like a skinny little punk, but this is how most male anime characters look! Besides these minor complaints I think this was a nice departure from the ""kiddie"" style American cartoons seem to hold on to. So give this a try and wait till 5 or so episodes in to form an opinion."
1570.2."not what i expected being a wolverine fan ; this is nothing like i expected. really don't like the drawing or storyline. looks fake."
1571.1."Very poor vision of Wolverine I have seen an episode of this show and all I could say is WOW, what a travesty. This show is completely not Wolverine. First Logan is Canadian not Japanese, short not tall, older looks middle aged even though much older not like a teenager. Voice acting is poor. This show is the William Shatner of Wolverine, extreme over acting and over dramatized action sequences. This is supposed to be Marvel Comics Wolverine not a Wolverine DragonBall Z. If they want to make a good Wolverine Cartoon keep it on par with the comics both in the character models and story, and use voice actors that have worked in the past, and if you really want to do Wolverine Justice make it a Mature rated cartoon and show Blood in the battles."
1572.5."Another Fine Parsifal Recording There are many very fine recordings of Parsifal in the catalog. In fact, it's difficult to find a poor performance. The highlight of this production is the magisterial Gurnemanz of Kurt Moll--possibly the best rendition ever. He is ablely supported by the poet of the baton Rafael Kubelik and a virile James King as Parsifal, also possibly his best recorded role ever. The recording has a wide and deep sound stage with excellent sonics. I enjoyed listening to this excellent studio rendition. Wagnerian singing of the highest standards.This recording is near the top of my favorite stereo studio editions along with Karajan's also fine rendition on DG recorded the same year as this one(1980). For the historically minded, I would recommend Krauss's 1953 Bayreuth live air check or Knappertsbusch's 1951 Bayreuth live recording on Decca. Karajan's live Vienna aircheck from 1961 on RCA is also interesting, but sounds older than the earlier recommendations."
1573.4."Good Basic CO Alarm Simple, straightforward , and no problems in the few weeks I've had this. Very good price. Good basic protection. I now prefer First Alert over their major competitor, after a problem with that companies' detectors , and their customer service did not seem to care at all. First Alert's customer service appears superior to me."
1574.5."First alert plug in Carbon Monoxide Alarm I was very pleased with my first alert plug in Carbon Monoxide Alarm. I like it because it is not that noticeable. It's not an ugly plug in and I like that. We received it in the time that they said it would be delivered and I would not hesitate to order again from Amazon. We have ordered many, many things from Amazon and have never been disappointed with their service.Thank you,Mary Lou Pantuso"
1575.3."Died after nearly four years, just so you know. Well, don't know if it would have worked, but not having CO around is good, right! After not quite four years of sitting on the wall, it started warning beeps out of nowhere, when there wasn't a possible source of CO around. Tested it on a few different walls and in another building and it still beeped, so its apparently malfunctioning.I guess it got bored after four years. I hope it was working properly all this time."
1576.1."Not UL Listed ""what's up with that..."" I bought this first alert CO alarm for my home in Wisconsin.When I started to read the instructions I found that this product is not UL list! How can a safety item like this not be UL listed.I did some research and found out first alert changed testing labs to save a few bucks and do not use the most well known UL. What's up with that...So I returned this CO and purchased the Kidde KN-COB-DP-H Plug-In Carbon Monoxide Alarm. The Kidde unit cost less too, so I saved a few dollars! Always pays to READ THE FINE PRINT."
1577.5."Easy to use, trusted After opening the package, I simply plugged this in to a wall socket (making sure that it is not near a heating source, gas, moving air, dust or sunlight). I tested it, the alarm rang loud and clear. A red light lets me know that it is functional.I feel better having it in my house."
1578.5."Easy Easy to install, just find an outlet in center of home. Product is made by first alert too which gives me confidence in operation."
1579.1."Defective product We bought this item twice. The first time, it was defective and wouldn't work (it made a dull sound all the time, and no additional sound at all when put in contact with water, as per the test described on the instructions sheet), so we returned it to Amazon (thanks for your excellent returns policy!) for an exchange. When the 2nd item proved just as defective, we got our money back. Don't waste your money on this junk -- buy something more expensive and substantial."
1580.5."very good product Great product. i gave this product to my son and i feel much better that he and his family are safer from carbon monoxide. thanks."
1581.3."CO 2 Detector This co2detector met my expections.The only thing lacking is a battery back-up. Of course I knew this when I bought it."
1582.4."Fist Alert CO600 Plug In Carbon Monoxide Alarm The Carbon Monoxide Alarm met what I needed for my rental house. I like the idea of the plug in vs the battery only type. The Alarm has a battery back-up, which covers a power failure.The new law requires the CO Alarms for rentals and homes. Reasonable price too !"
1583.4."Does the Job I just plugged it in and it's on the job. Perhaps it would be more assuring if it had a digital read-out of level of monooxide in the air."
1584.2."weird notification beeps This went off in the middle of the night after my husband and I had had it for several years. We had to look up online the directions because it didn't have a clear beep for a warning and for a battery replacement. It was ridiculous. I would not recommend it. I want one that clearly tells me when to vacate the house and call the fire department."
1585.2."My bad, but theirs too It did not even occur to me that a plug-in CO detector would not have battery back-up, which is my fault for missing that. However, what the?? I mean, they ALL should have batter back-up. This one has to go back."
1586.5."No Brainer! I chose this alarm because it was the easiest to use. Just plug it in and that's it. I have a gas fireplace and was told that I needed a carbon monoxide detector. Plugged into a regular outlet, it has a dim light to let you know that it's working and you can test the monitor at any time to make sure it's ""alarmed."" Hopefully, I'll never have to see how well the monitor works in an emergency but I feel safer knowing that I have one."
1587.4."Carbon Monoxide Alarm I feel that these are a necessity especially if you live in colder winter climates where you may have the windows closed for a few months.I prefer this model as it plugs in to an outlet rather than battery operated units.I found the models through Amazaon were several dollars cheaper than stores around my area."
1588.2."WARNING: This is not an instructional video!! I bought this video from Lullabot as soon as it was released. I've managed several Drupal projects and am now diving in to development myself. I was very disappointed, this video has no instructional content whatsoever. It is a very (very) high level view of what Drupal is. I give it two stars for good production value, only.I am hoping this is the first in a series of videos that will dive deeper into Drupal."
1589.4."Solid tripod, great deal Easily the best tripod I've ever owned, including some considerably more expensive ones. The only problem was with the remote. You must turn on the video camera before connecting. When the camera turns off automatically, disconnect the wire, turn on the camera, plug the remote back in. What a pain."
1590.2."tripod sony This tripod is out of production, although I bougth it because the price and the need of lanc connection for my camcorder Sony DSR PD170, was the only model with a reasonable price. The desadvantage is that it can not hold stablity for the camcorder, too light, not enough hight, and the locks for the vertical and horizontal moves are not good enough, you loose in trying to loose or tight the buterfly nuts. The only advantage is the remote controller and the price. I hope Sony can improve it like the next level but with more confortable price."
1591.3."Sturdy but lacking in certain key areas This tripod is sturdy and is taller than most which is important to me as i want my camera to be at eye level or higher. The cheaper versions with remote are shorter although lighter.The single biggest problem with this tripod is the remote control for the zoom. It is reverse of what would be intuitive. Pushing the buttom IN zooms OUT; likewise pushing OUT zooms IN. I even tried to rewire the switch but didn't find a way to do so. I had soder iron at the ready, but the fine ribbon cable was too delicate for the necessary surgery to make me rate this tripod high. While its no fluid head; the pans and tilts are fairly smooth. Smooth enough for what I use it for which is capturing my kids' sporting events.Lastly, for the price i'm willing to put up with the backward ergonomics of the zoom. You just have to 'think' about your zooms more than you would prefer to.Great price from the remanufacture site..."
1592.3."Doesn't consistenly keep good connection For some reason the power plug seems to be just a little off in size. Doesn't consistently supply power unless it is held in just the right position. Luckily, the USB connector and the power plug are connected by such a short cord that when the USB connector is plugged in then it pulls the power plug to where it needs to be. Works either plugged directly into Karma or plugged into the dock."
1593.5."A great collection of songs on this karaoke disc 1. Suerte - Shakira2. Si Te Vas - Shakira3. Ojos Asi - Shakira4. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio - Shakira5. Objection - Shakira6. Tu - Shakira7. Sombra De Ti - Shakira8. Que Me Quedes Tu - Shakira9. Te Dejo Madrid - Shakira10. Octavo Dia - Shakira11. Ciega, Sordomuda - Shakira12. No Creo - Shakira"
1594.3."Just ok... The locket has a very nice appearance and there is a inner plastic cover that holds the photo in nicely. The negative is the very little use of silver in this locket, there is absolutely no heft to this, it almost feels like it is made out of foil. Opening the locket is very difficult and it felt like it would just break because it had to be pried on so much to open. Being somewhat handy I was able to adjust the latch to a more reasonable level."
1595.1."False I have read alot of Krishnamurti,Probably the greatest teacher I have came across,But this book is no better than Humpdy dumpty or the Bible, If it is K which I very much doubt he must have been very immature to write this hollow meaningless stuff.His other works are consistant and valuable, among the most valuable words ever written,This book has less wisdom than the average person on the street"
1596.4."Spiritual guidance from the East This is a delightful little book of wisdom. It is a great read for anyone searching for greater spirituality in their life. It is not really a book of any particular religion or Denomination. It is just a bit of guidance from a great master. Krishnamurti does not try to convert anyone. He merely nudges people to seek aims greater than themselves. I find it a quick read that can also be read over again numerous times. In fact, I suggest it be read through once quickly and then referred to sporadically to absorb all the wisdom. It is a spiritual reference book that holds value over time."
1597.5."High quality and so cute! We love this set -- we used it for our daughter, and now we're using it for our son. Sumersault is rated highly by Baby Bargains, and this set is well worth the money. It's held up really well for us over almost three years. FYI, it goes well with the Pottery Barn ""classic stars"" rug in blue."
1598.1."OMG! this Movie is too wierd to be watched sober. I think it deserves the one star. maybe even 2 if I was drunk.... but I was'nt! Oh God, how I wish I had been. I can't tell you why I kept watching after the first half hour. I guess I expected it to become something .. ummm good..! quite an unusual film. if you watch it please tell me what you thought of it and what you think I missed. I don't watch Mexican movies ever..! & now I think I know why.... they make my brain all mushy and then it pours out of my ears and I fall over dead and brainless! OMG.. and the last 15 minutes... I could have slit my wrists, it was that bad! Sorry, Have I said too much.?"
1599.4."Historical Account of RCA A comprehensive history of Radio Corporation of America, from its formation in 1919 to its pending merger with General Electric in 1986. The CED VideoDisc system is only briefly discussed towards the end of the book, but this book puts it in the perspective of the corporation as a whole."
1600.4."The Book's Title is Self Explanatory This is a great history book on the great Mongol Empire. It clears up a lot misunderstandings and superstitions about the supposedly horrible Mongol barbarians and gives a reliable account of their rule in this time period. It covers Temujin's (aka Genghis Khan) beginnings to the end of his forebears rule. It has pictures from the past and of re-enactments of Mongol cavalry - you will rarely find this elsewhere. The Mongol Empire was a militaristic nation, so this book lacks on the military strategy and warfare of the Mongols. Only the basics are covered."
1601.5."Strait as an arrow Great product, good price, I have shot them several times and never had anything go wrong. I did robin hood one of them but that was my fault."
1602.4."First crossbow kill Been trying to make my first crossbow kill for a couple of years. Never could make it happen then I got a new Horton Crossbow and some of these carbon express arrows with muzzie broad heads and one shot one kill. The shot was a 28 yds and the deer ran another 50 yds and crashed in the woods. She did manage to break the shaft off when she fell since I hit her in her shoulder and instead of a clean pass through. Still accurate arrows."
1603.3."Not bad The vest quality is not bad. The price was very good and it looks nice. The vest is reversible, but the inside is smooth and does not have the same vest look as the outside, so I wear it only one way."
1604.3."not bad This is not $125 quality as it indicates, more like a mid-tier clothing store quality. the down is about 3/4 inch thick, not as heavy as it looks in the picture. it runs a little big for the size. Still not bad for the price I paid, but not a steal either."
1605.3."this book needs two separate ratings... one for the projects and one for the art. my rating for the projects would be a TWO. While it has some good ideas for making art in your journal, it is called ""Making journals by hand"" and the instructions for making journals are terrible. things like, ""get a stack of paper and take it to kinkos to have it bound."" NOT how to do it yourself. This book will NOT help you learn to make books. It also has a lot of terms that it never defines, and if you're not an experienced book maker, you won't know what they mean.On the other hand, I would give a rating of FIVE stars for the art and inspiration. the pictures and journals are absolutely gorgeous. They're too small, though, and you want to see everything closer.But, since this book is called ""making journals by hand""... it is NOT helpful for that, and so I give it three stars."
1606.2."Skimps on Content While the journals in here were really beautiful, it doesn't look like the author put a lot of effort into explaining them. It only took me about an hour to read this book and, even with a few creative ideas(mostly from the pictures), the general content was sparse. Some of the shaded sections on the side looked like space filler (for example, one on ""themes"" describes a travel journal's purpose as ""chronicling your travels""...no way!). It bothers me when writers use pretty pictures to try and pull off the appearance of a quality book. Flip through this book in the library to get some good ideas, but don't expect thoughtful written advice."
1607.2."Doesn't live up to title While this book has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful books and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to ""make"" them. The advice on putting together a complicated book with non-linear pages is limited to 3 steps, with no list of supplies and vague instructions. Poorly edited, there are many grammatical mistakes or typos. Buy this book for inspiration, but not for instruction."
1608.3."A Visual Treat, But Needs More Content I enjoyed what there was in this book, but the generous use of white space and extended discussion on how to make your own books left little room for the subjects of most interest to me, namely the appearance of artists' journals and suggestions for making visual enhancements to a a journal.The ideas there are very fine, indeed, but for the price and number of pages I simply expected more ideas. I'd recommend checking this book out of the library rather than actually purchasing it. I don't think it will grow on one as a reference."
1609.5."Wonderful Ideas I found this book to be extremely useful. The techniques were all new to me. The one that I am going to try first is the wax resist. I am a little worried about the other techniques that use solvents - I don't know where to buy them, and I don't want anything unnatural that is going to hurt my body. Overall, this is a lovely book. One department that does need a little bit of expansion is making the journal itself. However, I already have a blank journal that I bought from a bookstore beginning with Bor (they offer great blank journals CHEAP) and I am just going to use the techniques. Cheers!!"
1610.2."journal making? I bought this book wanting to learn how to make a journal. This book did not show the basics. It was a waste of money, the author seemed more interested in presenting cute ideas and making pretty pictures than teaching basics."
1611.3."Transmission cooling fittings not correct Nice radiator. Fit well, however the transmission cooling lines on my 98 C1500 w/ a 5.7L are 3/8"" however the fittings on the radiator are 5/16"". I had to buy two 3/8"" to 5/16"" inverted flare transmission adapters. Bought them at O'Reilleys for $6.51. Amazon web site confirmed this was a fit for my truck. Not a huge deal, but it delayed my repair and added some cost."
1612.1."Failed after 6 months Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. It fit perfectly and performed well for 5 months. The side tank seam started weeping last week. This week it is leaking a lot. I expected this to last much longer. I will purchase another brand next time or go to a junk yard and get one from there."
1613.2."For collectors only! This CD only contains 2 songs, both of which are available on Madonna's first album. Definately only for those who can't stand not having any given Madonna cd for their expansive collection."
1614.2."Not my type of book I just couldn't get into this book. Right from the start, it seemed like the author was trying to hide something from the reader and that annoyed me. Also, it contained too many long descriptions. Not my type of book."
1615.4."Funny movie This movie is chock full of slapstick comedy so if you don't like that, you won't like this movie. However, it always makes me laugh. I love it!"
1616.1."Same old junky print! Was hoping that this would be an upgrade to the many versions I have bought over the years. Sadly it is not. It is taken from the same horrible print. Decent movie, but baaaaad quality. Let the buyer beware! This is the item I bought. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YVX9/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1617.5."great fun for the whole family I have loved Lewis and Martin since I was a child and now I share the fun with my children. My 5 year old loves the hilarious stunts Lewis does and the soda machine scene must be rewound and played over and over. He has tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. I highly recommend for the family."
1618.2."Good Times Video...Skip it What Dean & Jerry fan does not know of this movie?My intention is to save those of us collectors time and money.The Good Times Video version appears to have been recorded from a vhs - that was itself recorded from another vhs without Time Base Correction - about 10 times.It's presented as Academy Standard 1.37:1 (original film aspect)Yep - that bad. Perhaps it was better than nothing, but now that something has hit the market, do yourself a favor, skip this version."
1619.2."Dean and Jerry on a Low Budget The slow-paced ""At War with the Army"" (1950) was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' first starring feature - a bargain-basement military farce that separates the team for much of its footage. Some nice moments (the ""Going My Way"" parody remains priceless), but not enough to justify the endless 93-minute length. One of the comedy duo's weakest efforts."
1620.3."It's worth watching, but... I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this movie but considering it was a first it wasn't a bad attempt. We did get a few laughs, but not as many as I had hoped for.All three of my children are die-hard old comedy movie buffs and this one only held the attention of the oldest (14-year-old). The other two drifted off to more interesting activities.I'll definately watch it again but it'll never rank in my top favorites I'm sorry to say."
1621.2."Hmmmmmm... I guess I didn't find this CD memorable, as I couldn't even remember what it sounded like. There were no particular pieces that jumped out at me and cried ""Dance to me."" Overall I was not that impressed."
1622.1."JUNK! (says China on product) When will people stop digging for the lowest possible price? I would have paid three times this price to have a quality product. After three pumps the check valve that holds the air in the rocket failed. You would push the pump in and all the air would get sucked out of the rocket when you pulled the pump back out. Then the mounting nipple snapped off when releasing the rocket from the clamp. Never worked once! Would like to find one that works, but they all look the same."
1623.1."Can't get it to work I used to love these rockets back in the day when I was a kid, so I got one for my 11-year old son. When it arrived, it looked like the ones I had as a kid, but was obviously of cheaper quality. Then again, it cost only a few bucks. Problem is, when I put the water in and then snap close the end of the pump, all the water leaks out! This happens whether the rocket is pointed up or down. The rocket is totally useless and we had to throw it away. Too bad, those rockets sure were fun a long time ago..."
1624.1."Memory Lane?? I bought 2 of these hoping to show my kids one of the toys I had growing up. Wow, these are straight CRAP. Why would someone produce a product that SUCKS this much?!! The clip that holds the rocket to the pump doesn't hold the rocket on. The O-ring is a dried, hard, brittle piece that doesn't seal. Then, when you get past ALL that crappy-ness, the pump shaft will either pull completely out, bend like a pretzel while pumping, or leak water into the pump itself! I got three launches out of 2 of these. I was more disappointed than the kids were. Boooooo!"
1625.1."Ron Not as pictured. Doesn't seal well for the launch and so it is pretty much worthless. I had the one pictured when I was a kid and was pretty excited to order and now left with disappointment. Order what you see and you may get something else and cheaply made. Maybe should have bought this back in 2006 when it got better reviews. Amazon, please take this off your site!! It indeed is less than a quality product and your company is deceiving those who buy."
1626.2."Old School Rocket Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Not surprising for the cost. These were popular when I was a kid and this model WAS enjoyable while it lasted."
1627.1."Junk Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not."
1628.1."Don't bother. Boring. What was I expecting? Something that would give me insight into my own abilities to heal self and others. This didn't do it. Especially since it wasn't in English."
1629.5."Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer."
1630.4."Dense with knowledge This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles."
1631.4."The knowledge of Healing The knowledge of Healing was a great explanations of Tibetan Herbs, treatments etc...that truly work, better then our deadly chemicals...they have been used to heal anything and everything since 5000 yrs and more; their correct diagnosis of the different pulses is very effective...treating illness with heat or cold treatments...along with prayers...how can anyone go wrong..."
1632.4."Works like a charm I recently broke my foot and were put in a FP Walker boot. The 1st couple of days were no fun with the skin on the back of my heel rubbing. I could not get a normal sock on due to the swelling.These socks rock! Easy to put on and padding in all the right places.I am definitely buying some more."
1633.2."Not great I guess these would be good if you had foot surgery and wanted to place something lose and protective over bandaging, but not for under a boot cast. I was under the impression these would be tall enough to almost reach my knee. They only go about 4"" above the ankle. Very wimpy, probably wouldn't hold up to too many washes."
1634.3."Pictures would really improve this book While this book provides great descriptions of the positions, there are very few images for reference. For one to truly practice yoga, posture and alignment are extremely important -- if trying these positions without a guide, you may not receive the same benefits. Ask your yoga instructor to go over the proper postures before you practice them on your own."
1635.1."NOT WORTH THE MONEY This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it."
1636.1."Come on............. We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
1637.1."Unbeliavable.... So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless."
1638.3."""Late night drive in film...long on flesh, short on story"" It's your typical 70's late-night on a Saturday drive-in theater experience;shot on grainy 16 mm film, with a relatively lame ""plot"", it was an excuse to show lots of female flesh;THAT... it most certainly does !Lots of skin, highlighted by the beautiful, red-haired Sharon Kelly, who would achieve adult film success as Colleen Brennan. Her scene is smoking hot, and is awfully close to hardcore porn...It's fun to watch late at night, and is so typically 1970's.It's OK. 3 stars."
1639.3."Ok This book is alright but I feel that the author shouldconcentrate more on the plot and dispense with the puns... they'regetting irritating... I started reading xanth when I was 8 and was hooked instantly- I couldn't wait for the next book to come out! But now I think the books are getting worse and worse... frankly this is sort of a disappointment... I much prefer the earlier books."
1640.3."Enough with the Adult Conspiracy already! This is not a bad book, but it would have been better if the author would concentrate on story-telling and humor, including the inevitable puns. I am no prude. There is nothing wrong with sexual innuendo, or outright sex for that matter. I read plenty of books that have sex in them. That said, I think the whole Adult Conspiracy sub-plot is getting way out of proportion in recent Xanth books. No one reads Xanth books looking for titillation. Also, why the thinly veiled social relevance? Anthony is always complaining about the ""cri-tics"" and I begin to wonder if he is responding to them by force-feeding political correctness into the stories. There is plenty of fiction, even fantasy fiction, on the market that addresses serious issues. Xanth books are marketted as being light entertainment, so why not provide that? Despite all that, I enjoyed the book. I just would've enjoyed it a lot more without the coyness and PC attitude."
1641.5."Just when you thought it couldn't get any better in Xanth Now look, I know Piers Anthony is a great author. I've read his Incarnation of Immortality series, all the Xanth books, the Mode books, and the Apprentice Adept series. But this, I have to say, is the best of the bunch. What do you get when you cross a young black Mundane with a magical talent, a 130 year old man who was transformed into a tree, three kings, and a mess of zombies? Believe it or not, one of the best surprises to come into Xanth in years, thanks to the devious plotting of Good Magician Humphrey, Clio the Muse, and everybody's favorite elf, Jenny of the World of Two Moons. For all of us raised on fairy tales, this one beats them all."
1642.5.The most complex yet potentially important yet! I have just finished this novel, and must say that it is very complex, yet sets up countless options for the future of Xanth! This book is a story of love, hate, prejudice, potential adultery, and a complete denial and rejection of the Adult Conspiracy! If you love the Xanth novels, you MUST read this book!
1643.4."Nice, handy, and lightweight philosophy dictonary. Nice, handy, and lightweight philosophy dictonary."
1644.3."Could be better Having been dx'd with AML I wanted a comprehensive but understandable text to keep near by and refer to as the situation warranted. At first I found it helpdul but then I had more complex questions and the answers were not there. Specifically I needed a better explanation of all the CD's and their effect , affect, I never know which to use, on my leukemia. I also needed much more information on blasts and what different levels indicate. I felt that side effects of chemo and drugs needed to be addressed more thoroughly, and GVHD certainly needed much more space.I would say this is a fine starting point but does not have all the answers. Oh, I found the anecdotes nothing but space wasting"
1645.5."The answers to a serious, life threatening disease I have a friend who has a family history of this disease. He wanted the most current information so I ordered it for him and he found it very valuable.Doc"
1646.2."Earland below average This 1991 Muse Records CD (out of print)is among Earlands weakest B-3 performances recorded. Standard tunes like ""Unforgetable"" and ""Europe"" (yes, the Santana hit) is arranged and played like elevator music and goes nowhere...But there are moments where Earland shines and cook's predictable with his combo like on ""Sheila"" and ""Kicker"", but thats all. Even Earland's sidemen like Eric Alexander on tenorsax does not lift the overall performance quality. Thia is not capured misic, this manufactured music. For Earland collectors - put this CD in your shelf and start looking for Earlands recordings on Prestige, Milestone and Savant/HighNote"
1647.5."New Mexico meets Iraq I have very little to add to these semi-enlighted reviews (above).However, of all his albums, I prefer the immediacy and dialogue here between these masters of string & percussion.We're blessed here in Land of Enchantment to have Alhaj in our midst, and on Music faculty of state university, UNM. It's a secret, but he also has a delicious sense of humor..."
1648.4."inspiring book on an important topic..... I also read this book when it was first available last year as an e-book, and I definitely found it inspiring. Body image + sexuality are inextricably linked, and I found Miss Dodd's personal accounts of her struggles to be fascinating and ultimately inspirational. Buy this book for your teenage daughter!"
1649.5."I've told half the women I know about this one! There are very few books that I recommend to other readers, because I assume that everyone has their own tastes and their interests -- especially in the area of ""self-help."" But, this book covers such a far reaching subject, and I think just about every woman I know could benefit from it. This woman talks about body image in regards to sex, dressing, jobs, long term success, even friendships.It really is inspirational, and it changed the way I looked at my waist, hips, thighs, butt, you name it!"
1650.3."Not about food so much This was an enjoyable film that examined the dynamics of a varied group of family members dealing with the death of a loved one. Sadly though, I was hoping for something more along the lines of ""Like Water for Chocolate"" or ""Chocolate"" or ""Eat Drink Man Woman"". I wanted to see Chinese culture as experienced around the dining table. Still, all in all, I'm not sorry about this purchase."
1651.1."BIG THUMBS DOWN I rented this thinking it would be an interesting subject on American-Chinese tradition here in the U.S. But I was wrong, it was a total disappointment. The story and its sub-plots are too contrived. The script is very formulaic; even adding a twist at the ending was typical and intentional - just so for audiences who likes a twist in their movies. Any viewer wouldn't get involved watching this film. Basically this is about a group Chinese-American siblings who has hang-ups with themselves and among each others. Set in the affluent neighborhood of San Francisco, it portrays an embarrassingly rich family by showing the amenities of the matriarch's sprawling extravagant house. Tennis, a dip in the pool, jacuzzi anyone? Jeez! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
1652.3."Not bad, but not great. The set looks very nice and elegant. I have no problems with the glasses, it's the shaker that bugs me. There's a bit of leak when you try and shake it. But worse, when the glass gets wet it gets really slippery, so you have to take extra care, not to let it slip out of your hands.I'm probably going to buy another shaker and just put mine away for looks or something."
1653.3."4 Fabulous 1 Loser The glasses are absolutely fabulous. Very 1950's....retro.They have texture with the ribbing and are very one of a kind.The Glass Shaker is the pits....the top doesn't stay on very well and there is a great likelyhood that it could fly off.But the value is still there for the glasses."
1654.2."Aesthetically pleasing but not functional While I like the looks of this set a lot, with its retro feel, I find the shaker to be in need of a design overhaul. Every time this is used (and it's been used by several people so I don't think it's a user problem) it spills while pouring! This has been very frustrating to lose good top shelf vodka because of poor design. I had to go out and purchase another shaker because of this problem so I would not recommend this set."
1655.4."Very Nice I got a similar set (3-pc with shaker and 2 glasses). I agree with the other reviews about the shaker, it leaks a little bit. I suggest getting another shaker, but keeping this one around as a back-up OR wrapping a small towel around the leaky seam. I like the texture of the shaker and glasses. It's classy and not so overdone that it's tacky."
1656.1."Beware The set is cute to look at, but as far as actually using, it is terrible. The glasses are fine, but the shaker is so hard to use, I actually took a chunk out of my finger trying to get it open to refill it! I've never used it again."
1657.2."A booklet- not a textbook! At 60 pages,this is over-priced and not a course for adults. As basic instruction for those 10 and under, it is probably okay. For anyone who even doodles while talking on the phone- forget it!"
1658.4."A real gem!! I took a class from Bruce McIntyre in 1968 or maybe 1969. I enjoyed it so much and buying this drawing book brought back memories of what I had learned then. He makes drawing much easier than I thought it was but showing easy things to use to make the picture come to life. A friend borrowed my books from the class and I never got them back when I moved so I was elated to get the Drawing Textbook from Amazon. YEA!!!"
1659.5."Required for Art class Drawing Textbook by Bruce McIntyre is required for an art class I'm in. I like how it laid out and easy to follow away from class. I love that I was able to find it on amazon.com so I could get my own copy. It helps that I don't have to try to follow along with several others at the same time."
1660.5."Alaskan Beauty This book was more than I expected...the pictures are lovely - really makes you want to visit Alaska but if you can't you can certainly enjoy this book....."
1661.2."Inexpensive but poor quality The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand ""new"" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged). I can't imagine using them for metal, let alone most rubbers. Despite the very affordable price, I would NOT have purchased this set for the above reasons."
1662.2."Not for Metal! Received this in great time- I have no problem with the seller:-)BUT! The inside of the case lists all types of materials this can cut including metals, which is what I got it for.One punch through soft 26ga copper sheet and the edges of the punch bent & in some areas, flaked off. The second disk I cut did it in completely. I had to file all of the edges and it probably would have been easier to cut the sheet with shears.So, not for metals.However, I can see it would be great for leather, paper & plastics.To me it was worth the money spent on the chance that it would actually cut metal disks."
1663.1."Not good! I purchases this set for simple craft projects...mainly to cut card stock and cardboard. I tried hammering the punches with my 12 oz. hammer and it didn't go through the card stock. Got my husbands big beefy hammer...it still will not punch through thin card stock. I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $"
1664.3."SE Hollow Punch Pretty decent tool to use around the house with reasonable price for an average quality. It's OK for home use."
1665.1."Dull and dirty Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see"
1666.2."BEWARE OF SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN! I really dont want to give this product a bad rating as it is just a simple tool that does what its supposed to. But it has a serious safety flaw/problem!!:The kit came with no instructions, so I was figuring out how it worked, and as I was turning the screw on the side of the barrel, the sharp pointed 2 inch pin needle inside the barrel shot out like a projectile dart. It was spring loaded and the screw is what held it in.Luckily it wasnt aimed at myself or anyone, because it could have caused serious injury. After the pin shot out I was left feeling very disturbed that this tool could have taken out my eye out.So, I feel compelled to warn and advise others who might be buying this tool set."
1667.2."West Coast Avant Garde Listen to the sound bite before you buy. I didn't, but I should have. This is way to modern for me, I like cool west coast jazz, but this is sort of Ornette Coleman meets Karlheinz Stockhausen--very modern in tone. If that is your bag, the album is for you, otherwise pass this one by."
1668.3."long legs the product is nice, my 4 years old daughter love it, the boots are looooong, but over all is ok, don't wash it at tha washer machine, do it by hand. the fabric is extremely delicated. buy it you and your daughter will have a lot of fun"
1669.3."just okay... I purchased this costume for my 3 1/2 year old daughter because she wants to be a purple ""action hero"" for Halloween and this is the one I could find with some purple on it. The costume is cute, but when I took it out of the package, it was all stuck together. Half of the purple that she wanted so badly came off the skirt when I pulled the costume apart. Also the boots are way to high. My daughter is taller than the average and has long legs - the other reviewer was right the boots go high, right up under the shirt, not like what was shown in the picture. I think this costume was very cheaply made for the price, but my daughter loves it so I guess it is okay."
1670.4."pretty good Got this through Amazon for my daughter's superhero party. She could hardly wait to put it on. The quality is OK - some parts (like the skirt) have gotten stuck together and the color has come off a bit. For a costume though, it'll serve a good purpose, and provide hours of fun. The boots a really high. My daughter is tall for her age, but the boots go all the way up (and even under) the skirt. Just FYI."
1671.4."Useful history A useful history of the last days of Soviet rule and the early days of democracy in Russia, told through the stories of several, mostly prominent individuals. It provides a nice portrait of what exists, but lacks deep analysis to answer the question of why."
1672.5."Fantastic Account of The Soviet Union Highly recommended. This book not only gives a stunning history of the Soviet Union but also a much more personal account of the people who live there. This is truly a must read for anyone interested in Russia and the problems it faces today"
1673.2."Printing is WAY too small! Book is over 600 pages and the print is so small it was difficult for me to try to read so I returned it. Perhaps if it ever comes out on Kindle I would try again."
1674.2."Lenin's Tomb : The Last Days of the Soviet Empire this book should be a text book for those studying soviet history. the author assumes that the reader is very well informed--certainly better informed that i am. he drops names that are mostly meaningless and impossible to put into context! his vocabulary is beyond the college level. do you know the word ""ramify""? i didn't.but the positive side is that remnick has done remarkable research. he has put himself into situations that have put him at risk. his descriptions are graphic and frightening. he is courageous.i read the first half, but couldn't continue. it is part of my too hard file."
1675.5."IT'S A KNOCKOUT !! Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid ""history books"" will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved."
1676.4."unable to put it down great book with lots of great anecdotes and small, personal biographies of those power capitalists who entered the Russian business scene as the communist era turned its last page."
1677.5."A respectable work of history This is a very revealing and perhaps most revealing account of the last days of the Soviet Union put forth in a concise manner for the reader. It is smooth flowing, vivid in its descriptions and captured the mood at the time in such an authentic way. The reliance on interviews gives a lot of credibility to the narration and the portrayal of the character in the the situations they found themselves in. The society as a whole is bared for he reader to understand and the system's shortcomings are exposed. I read The Union Muzhik the other day and from it, understand the hopes of Perestroika and Glasnost that the demise of the Soviet Union failed to bring to the people."
1678.3."Good Story Teller But One Must Be A Detective To Gain Insight Remnick tells a good story (or, more accurately, a series of short, personalized stories) of the last days of the Soviet Empire. I was looking for insights ... and they are there ... buried under much narrative. He receives rave reviews and gives a good, first-hand, eye-witness account of 'what' happened. But I struggled to find out 'why' it happened and as such, I struggled to finish the book."
1679.3."big and sturdy but... The binder I received does not have covers that meet. The back cover sticks out 1/4 inch or more from the front cover when the binder is closed. Hopefully, this is a one off and the others are not the same."
1680.5."Huge, high-quality binder I bought this binder to hold a 700+ page anatomy book that was published unbound, and it probably could have held at least two books that size. It's huge. The pockets, D-rings, and opening mechanism are all top quality.When measuring how much space you'll need for this binder in your bookshelf, backpack, etc., remember that the rings themselves are four inches, so the binder is even wider, close to five inches. The side of the binder with the rings will non-negotiably need that much room."
1681.1."Broke within the first week I bought this binder for my son who started middle school. Withing the first week, one set of rings did not close properly and now my son has to carefully go through his notebook so the papers don't fall out. Everything gets stuck at the point where the rings don't completely close. Poorly made product."
1682.5."Same dependable Avery quality I keep all of my equipment manuals and owners' guides in these, and needed to add a volume. The others were bought in 2005, so I was worried that I might not be able to get the same durable quality. I worried needlessly. These are up to the usual Avery standards."
1683.1."Probably the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. If you check the credits after the movie it appears as if the producer hired his family and friends as the actors. Summary (no pun intended): Horrific acting (I could have acted those scenes better than the so called actors; Frightful script (who talks like that anyway ""The zombies are breaching our stronghold, I would advise that we seek an alternative egress route in order to address the impending conflict""; Brain Blending effects: Nothing like a karate kick to the face that missed by about 6 inches yet knocks the zombie through the window. My review is more interesting than this movie. Give me a camcorder and an Amazon makeup kit (shameless plug) and I could have done this movie. There is nothing redeeming about this... NOTHING!"
1684.2."Come on is this Real?? You figure zombie movies have been out for at least 20 years and to this date we still can't produce a low budget zombie movie with better actors. The dialogue was good the presentation sucked. it was like they were reading the dialogue instead of experiencing it. The plot was good as well. This movie had all the elements of a well made zombie flick but no one was chomped only the token Lesbian Black chick. Good try but I wanted more."
1685.4."A jolly fun scare ride - perfect for Halloween! ""Z"" is the follow-up feature to ""Nightfall"" by Tempest. It's a jolly fun scare ride throughout, as you never know where the undead creatures (I hope that's not a spoiler) may be lurking. It reminds me of a Saturday afternoon matinee horror flick - full of thrills and action, but also with dashes of humor. ""Z"" is a film just perfect for Halloween - a relentless chase and pursuit as the characters try to survive, not knowing which way to turn. Also, interestingly, the creatures are very old-school - you'll hear and smell what I mean!!"
1686.3."good effort. For a movie that looks like it cost 250$ to make, It was ok. typical zombie film. But a good film for people who anything zombie."
1687.4."More Z's Please! This was a cool fast paced indie zombie movie. Would defiantly recommend friends and family to see this film. Would like to see what this company could come up with if given the opportunity to do a second or third zombie film. Oh and the disclaimer at the end of the film about no zombies being hurt during the filming of the movie was pretty neat too."
1688.1."dont waste your time or money. lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors"
1689.2."The DVD has missing segments! In the past, our family has purchased three videos from this series and LOVED THEM! This DVD advertised SIX segments on its cover and on Amazon's advertising, but only three interrupted segments were on the disc we received. In the end, the contexts for the stories are missing and so is one title of each segment pair intended to support the educational message. Has anyone else had this problem or do we have defective discs? We are returning ours to Amazon ASAP. and hope to get corrected discs."
1690.2."Poor quailty Item sizing was not consistent. Had to make modifications just to wear it and make it fit. Cheap and torn before could even use it."
1691.2."ok This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter's head. So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of. Perfect fit and much easier to wear!"
1692.2."not too durable. This was great as a Halloween Costume. however, after my daughter tried it on, one of the straps on the leg covers broke and the mask was too tight. Good for a one time use. My daughter enjoyed it."
1693.5."Bat Girl with Flare This Costume was just as it says. Was a great buy. The material was stretchy so it moved easily with my active child. No complaints."
1694.5."Pink Child Batgirl Costume Hello,This pink batgirl costume is the best and so perfect for this halloween! It's made well and the topic in kindergarten this past week has been all about bats!!! Daughter cannot wait to wear it and decided to become batgirl since she's already been a princess and ballerina before.Sandra M."
1695.3."Cheap! What do you do where your daughter begs for a Batgirl costume for well over 2 months before Christmas? You find her one, of course. BUT, where do you FIND a Batgirl costume in December? Amazon, of course. What if you don't want to spend much money? You buy one of the cheapest on the market mostly because it is pink, and your daughter LOVES pink. Why an OK rating? The boots are entirely too small to fit, the mask looks more like The Noid than Batgirl (please tell me I am not the only one who remembers Domino's Avoid the Noid commercials?), oh and it is about as flimsy of material as they could use aside from piecing it together with paper towels.So... the ultimate question ... was it worth the money? ...Um, YES!!! Daughter was ecstatic that Santa brought her what she wanted, which was more important than it being high quality or even fitting properly."
1696.3."Very cute with speedy delivery, but... I ordered this for my daughter to wear to her superhero-themed birthday party. It was delivered much faster than they estimated, which was fantastic. And despite reviews about it's quality I found it to be very durable, and it really is adorable. However, the sizing is incredibly inaccurate. I bought her a small (4-6), and while at the time she wore a 5 or 6, this was much too short and tight on her. She ended up having to wear tights under it, which she didn't care about but it bugged me that she wouldn't get much wear of out of it beyond her party, given how much it cost."
1697.2."Cape is very small/ fabric is very thin The material is thin thin thin which I expected from this kind of costume. The mask didn't really hold up for one halloween party and one night of trick or treating. The worst part was that the cape in the picture is big enough for the girl to hold with both hands but in reality it isn't that big at all. Also the velcro that holds the cape on didn't even hold up on Halloween night. Disappointing"
1698.4."Fabulous The costume came fast and fit awesome. My only complaint was with the shoe coverings. They broke easily and would not stay on my daughters shoes so we ended up not using them."
1699.2."Expect what you pay for The price was cheap and so was a majority of the craftsmanship. Also, the belt was not in the package and we bought it new."
1700.4."very cute This was super cute on my daughter and she absolutely loved it. Everything fit nicely. The only thing I did not like about the costume was that the second time my daughter wore it the fabric had already started to stretch and tear. It would be nice if they would make the material more durable for the kids costumes."
1701.3."Cheap Flimsy The costume is made from cheap thin material along with the mask almost feels like paper mashe. But my dauther loved it."
1702.2."Wouldnt buy it again! I bought two of these bat girl costumes for my two daughters. The masks started falling apart after the first time wearing them. The material was so cheap it literally fell apart!!! I was SO disappointed! By the time Halloween came I had completely redone the masks and stapled the silver belt back together.I have never rated anything before but I couldn't help myself, I want people to know what they are buying."
1703.2."Wouldn't recommend The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. After only a few wears, the mask and belt both broke. I wouldn't recommend this costume."
1704.3."Super cute but doesn't last Positives: This costume is extremely cute and my five year old daughter LOVES it. She even won 2nd place in a costume contest.Negatives: The mask is meant to be tight fitting and has elastic to pull it tight. The downside is that the material is so flimsy that the mask began to tear within about 5 minutes. This was a size medium and she is a very small five year old. Regarding sizing, the package says ""medium (u.s.a. size 8 - 10) for 5 - 7 years."" Well that makes perfect sense. The washing instructions are also interesting: ""Wipe clean with damp cloth. Line dry. Do not wash. Do not bleach. Do not iron. Do not dry clean."" That's nice. A costume you can't iron that arrives with a million wrinkles. A costume for a child that says ""Do not wash."" Obviously I don't need to add that it was made in China."
1705.4."Great Costume! This is a fabulous costume! My daughter loves it and has had it on every day since it arrived last week. She even slept in it a couple of nights. The other reviews are correct in saying that it needs some mending. We had to reinforce the velcro on the mask and the elastic on the bottom of the boots. After a little stitching it is fine. We also sewed on a small piece of material to the back of the face mask so that it wouldn't stretch any further and tear. This was a fabulous idea. Do it! I only deducted one star for this because the rest of it is great. The material is a durable shiny pink. My daughter is a size 4 and wears a size 9 shoe and the small fits perfectly. If she were a 5 or older I would get the medium. Totally worth the money."
1706.1."Too small and stained I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. I purchased the medium (size 8-10) and it is way too small. It's too short, tight around the shoulders, the boot covers don't cover her foot and the mask won't go around her head (not even close and again she's 50%ile in both height & weight for her age). This size would be better for a 5 year old! And if that isn't bad enough, the cape has a dark (non-removable) stain on it! I'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged."
1707.3."1st order too small The packaging says size small is for ages 3-4. The Medium is for ages 5-7. Did not know that when ordered initially for my 5 year old daughter. The small didn't fit had to reorder for medium."
1708.1."Bad thing The fabric is very common, the finishes are really bad, the mask was broken the first time, the layer has no seams, the fabric also is leadership, not what I expected."
1709.4."Great for a Costume My neice is four and wanted a superhero costume for Christmas and this is what I got for her.. This costume is not the most durable or made to withstand prolonged wear or washing, however it is great for what it actually is.. The material is pink and kind of shimmery and sparkle. My neice loved it so much she slept in it Christmas eve and wore it all day on Christmas! She loved this costume so very much and I feel as though it was money well spent."
1710.5."Awesome Costume This is a great costume. All the extra pieces make it really great. This is one of our favorite costumes."
1711.3."great costume My daughter loved this costume - she wore it to several times. It fit her perfectly- she is a size 5 so we ordered the small. My only complaint about the outfit is the velcro stuck to the cape and ripped the fabric. I wish the fabric were a little more durable."
1712.4."She loves it Pink Bat-girl is a hit at our house. She loves to dress up. Costume is a little flimsy but will last through the Halloween season and maybe some dress-up after. Skimpy and thin so plan on wearing something under it. (I wish we had bought a size larger) Don't be fooled by the cape it does not go over the shoulders, only behind the back. It is very cute and my 7 year old daughter loves it."
1713.5."SEAL TEAM TWO Nice work. Full disclosure. Some of these guys were drinking buddies when I worked in Norfolk . I produced the first TV documentary on SEALS"
1714.3."Went overboard with the bird sounds. Having grown up in the country, I can tell you that song birds do not constantly chatter away 19 hours a day...Some people may like what they've done here, but I was hoping for the real thing.Very disappointed."
1715.3."barely gets it done I ordered this as a stall shower rod. It works - barely.Much better I suspect as a curtain rod.Nice finish, just very lightly made - the word spindly comes to mind."
1716.2."thin The picture seems to show a somewhat robust rod, but what you get is a very thin (1/2"") rod. When exteneded to near its mazimum length it becomes very flimsy and will barely hold my small shower curtain without bowing in the middle. I would have expected a little better for the price and the intended use. But, it works and it's black."
1717.1."Item was nice color This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. We put it up at least four times and it fell down. I returned it. Color was nice, it was extremely thin."
1718.2."Disappointing The pieces that attach to the shower wall are very small. Because of this, the rod never stays in place!!"
1719.5."Sturdy, stylish rod This is a great rod if you need if for a little space. It is stylish while being sturdy. The accents on the end bring out more charater than other plain rods. Had a strong resistance so it stays up on the walls. Holds a material curtain as well as a liner and hasen't budged. Love this rod and would buy again."
1720.3."Curtain Rod This curtain rod is also used as a shower stall curtain rod. I found it to be small in diameter unlike the plastic versions offered at Bed, Bath & Beyond. It does not twist out for a snug fitting between the walls. I expect it to fall down with daily use."
1721.2."Too Small for a Shower Curtain This rod is way to small for use with a shower curtain. I have no idea why it even comes up in the search. It may work for a simple curtain, but I doubt it."
1722.3."Not one of the better quality tension rods, but at least I can get one in black I like the fact that I can get a tension rod in black. Too bad this style appears to be my only option. These rods look nice and, from a distance, they have the appearance of wrought iron, but they do not stay put for long. They loosen on their own, causing anything but the lightest curtain to take them down. Also, the little end cap that comes off so you can slip your curtain or rings on is also attached to the end that you twist to elongate or shorten the rod. Not a very good design and they cost about double what they are worth, but if you can get them to stay up, they look quite nice."
1723.2."Pretty, but not functional This curtain rod looks nice, but can barely hold any weight. It will only work with sheers."
1724.2."Shower Curtain Rod Review Umbra Coretto 24 to 36-Inch Decorative Tension Rod, BlackThe rod is really good looking. However, because it is so thin, the weight of my shower curtain keeps causing the rod to come loose. If I had any idea, I probably would not have bought the rod. However, my shower is at the wider end....so maybe a person would have better luck if their shower is closer to 24""."
1725.3."Disappointing As anticipated as a new Technotronic project was, this new single is disappointing. It has some good beats, but fairly repetitive and uninspired. It definitely lacks the creativity and personality -- and influence -- that TT's projects with Ya Kid K have. This CD has 3 mixes of the same song, one instrumental (minus the freestyle overdubbing of Monday Midnite)."
1726.4."So happy to see more Julia Child on DVD Why is it so hard for them to put out Julia Child DVD sets? Just when i was about to give up, they put 8 episodes from Baking With Julia. The set is wonderful and well worth the money. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the annoying menus you cant exit out of, and the fact only 8 episodes were released. Though I am happy to see a volume 2 is released as of March 1st!"
1727.3."Misleading title I LOVE Julia, let me say that and have been devouring everything I can find about her. I was very disappointed, however, that the title of this is misleading. I thought SHE would be baking, but it's a series of other people baking and she is standing next to them. I got a copy from the library, wanted to check it out before I bought it and am sure glad I did because I will pass on it. Actually, some of what I remember was contrary to techniques she taught on her videos--the people in the video used different techniques, so if you remember some of hers it will seem a little confusing. Just seemed like an attempt to keep her in front of the camera but really isn't about her."
1728.1."This DVD is not as represented in the description. There are only 8 out of about 24 episodes from the Baking With Julia series on the DVD. Amazon would not guarantee me a full refund if I returned it since I took off the plastic.Even though I had not viewed it. I didn't notice that it was only 8 episodes till after a tore the plastic off and looked at the back of the dvd. Definitely is not work the money."
1729.1."Sent damaged product I received this DVD in a well packed box with another item. The other item was in perfect condition. However, this DVD's case was broken in several (at least 4) places. As I said, the box was well packed and insulated. The DVD had obviously been sent in the damaged state it was received in. Most disturbing is the fact that the damage to the DVD case was so OBVIOUS. Pieces are broken off inside the celephane wrapping that you can see and, when you pick it up, you cannot miss feeling them.The DVD itself skips in several places.Unacceptable and unethical behavior on the part of the sender. They had to have known they were sending me a severely damaged DVD case. It had to have been damaged at the time they packed it in the box.As a result, I was not able to give it as a gift as planned."
1730.5."wonderful The DVD's are a great addition and compliment to the book. This would be wonderful for any cook from novice to expert."
1731.5."Anything Julia... This is one of three videos that comprise the show- about 8 episodes each to total approx. 24 episodes. I don't know how many were in the original show, so I can't say what percentage of it is on tape here. Reading the back covers, I don't see Martha Stewart's wedding cake presentation, although it was in the original show and that was great just by itself. It is really interesting to watch, and her guest chefs go slow enough to be able to reproduce what they are doing. It's good to have the companion book nearby by Dorie Greenspan, as well, so it's written down for you and you can focus on technique. More recipes in the book than on this DVD."
1732.2."Longevity I was initially impressed with the company and the product. The company ended up to be local which was a plus. The product didn't last a year and I purchased two of them. Both failed inside of a year."
1733.4."Nik comes into the 90's and away from the Pop I was delighted to find this newest incarnation after digging about for his other albums/CD's that were not released in the States and having to get them as imports. The guy would be big here with a little publicity. His lyrics are as ususal clever with twists and turns not found in most artists work. The fave so far is ""Billy"" (which probaby could have been named ""Sally Wants"" just as easily). Keep it up!! and keep cranking it out into the 00's!! Valkomen back!"
1734.4."Lyrical and mellow--classic Kershaw He's grown musically and hasn't lost his talent for interesting--almost arresting--lyrics. Fans of the Nik Kershaw who came to fame in the early 1980s will appreciate this album."
1735.4."Handy Device Very compact, well made, helps me level the camera when I set it on sloped surfaces and it stays in place due to the rubber feet. For the price and size it's a great alternative."
1736.5."Very nice design It's light, compact, and stable, easy to slip into a shirt pocket, and easy to use. It's great for fairly flat surfaces. From reading descriptions, the gorilla tripod (I think that's the name), while bulkier, is more versatile, since it can adjust for uneven surfaces and wrap around poles etc, but I haven't tried it."
1737.3."Good but there's a better option It's a clever design but i wouldn't put it in my pocket. I have a pocket monopod that also works as a steadicam. It's called a readysteady, and it really does fit in your pocket."
1738.5."Good Product The material was nice and clean, no rust and flat. Drills nicely and was easy to work with.Highly recommend."
1739.4."Basic cookbook It's a good basic book- no frills. Since it's my first Korean food cookbook I have nothing to compare it to. It has been helpful especially the glossary which describes terms."
1740.4."Great Vegetarian//Vegan Cookbook! I love Korean food but I had found it very difficult to find a good Vegetarian Korean cookbook until I stumbled onto this terrific book. I found fun and easy to prepare vegetarian and many vegan recipes in this very unique book."
1741.4."mostly for collectors I enjoyed A.F.'s other books enough to buy this one, although it is not nearly as practical. The sections on where to buy clothes are not only out of date by now, they are also designed for people who have far more money than most. Actually, I don't know why this book was published originally since, if you have the money to shop at these stores, you probably already know about them. It almost seems like a matter of credentialing, but who knows.I would buy one of A.F.'s other books if you are just looking for a men's clothing guide. However, if the subject matter really interests you, you will find that each of A.F.'s books covers much of the same ground, but in slightly different ways, so that there is value in reading all of them, including this one."
1742.2."Fasion, Fops, Faux Pas I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be ""Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion"", only recently published."
1743.1."Dreadful 3/4 of this book is where to shop, with locations noted in Chicago, Houston, Florence, Milan, NYC, Vienna, etc (but not Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong). The rest is spoiled by a pompous, overbearing style that makes it unreadable."
1744.2."Overrated book I bought this book a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. But I was disappointed. I read it once and I found the style of writing outdated and the content not so useful: many addresses where you should buy things, but how useful is that? I don't live nearby these places, and I want to learn WHY you should buy certain things so that I can decide for myself what is good to buy and what not. Such info is given only very briefly."
1745.1."Terrible What if you live outside of New York? This book isn't applicable for anyone outside ""The City."" Buy a book from John Bridges instead."
1746.4."An ageing shopping guide for dandies If you're seeking information on how to tell fine menswear from bad, skip this book and go directly to Flusser's new one.If you're a would-be dandy looking for information on where to buy men's furnishings around the world, buy the book (with a minor caution). Many of the stores in the U.S. have relocated and some have closed.On the other hand, I've used it to find choices in London and Paris that I would never have known about otherwise. And once you've made the initial investment in the measurements, you can patronize many of these establishments by telephone.A number of earlier reviews criticise Flusser for focusing on the finest quality and most expensive clothing in the world. It is, and he does. But for people who do or want to play that game, it's still the best source of information."
1747.4."Dated yet still relevant As noted by many reviewers, the clothing fact information is first rate.The second part of the book on shopping and retail establishments is so out of date in 2005 that I really question whether a purchase is worthwhile if retailer information is primary purpose of proposed purchase. A good 60% of the information on establishments in the US and London is totally outdated or the stores have gone out of business.Try the library or borrowing from a friend to see if any of the desired information is still relevant before purchasing. This book needs a serious update."
1748.1.sucks I just received two of these guns today and they both broke after about two minutes of shooting, don't buy it!!!
1749.1."Sorry, not convincing at all Well, as a vegetarian and resident of a country seeing exploding diabetic population ( India) I find this approach to diabetes unconvincing.ONE, the emphasis is on animal foods. This has three difficultiescultural prohibitionsbiological concentration of alien hormones, pesticides and antibioticsand last not least, the cost factor of such a diet.TWO there is compulsive testing of blood sugar levels.THREE it encourages dependency on the clinician.Where's the sense of freedom in all this?In my counselling sessions I use sprouted whole legumes, leafy vegetables, NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS, resistence exercises, meditation, family support. It all works fine."
1750.4."A must read! It took me some time to read this book. I read this first part avidly. Then read bits and pieces now and then. Blood glucose meter at hand I knew much of what he talks about but I did come across great insights.A must read for all people who have a problem with diabetes or better still with pre-diabetes. I do agree with most of all that is written in the book. A big part of the book is dedicated to Insulin usage which if you are not on it yet you might skip it. On the whole the book explains in layman terms the science behind glucose metabolism in our body. Pity there is no mention of any MODY diabetes which is increasingly becoming important as new discoveries are being done how actually what is called Type 2 diabetes is not as it is really depicted."
1751.1."Not Really for Diabetes II This book is mostly for those with Diabetes one.This is his second book.His first book was a good one and full of useful info for both types of Diabetes.If you are a Diabetic type I then this book is for you.If you are a Diabetic II then buy his first book.I am a Diabetic II and this book was really a waste of my money."
1752.1."Misleading Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Following this type of diet causes high acidic levels which causes illness. This diet is nothing new. My grandmother followed this kind of plan back in the late 40's because they thought ALL carbs were bad. Today we know that the brain needs glucose to function. Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's."
1753.5."Great Update! As with his first book, this book has more great information for me as a Type 2 Diabetic. Although my wife is not diabetic, we love ALL the recipe's in both books. They have kept my blood sugar in total control and are delicious! Thanks Dr. Bernstein!"
1754.5."The Solution: Properly Titled Of the 3 books on this subject by Dr. Bernstein that I have read including his suggested recipes, this is the most detailled and informative. I started practicing what Dr. Bernstein preaches and while it is indeed, difficult at first-especially when you look to revamp your food choices that were learned over your lifetime. After a week, the cravings tend to disappear and I am seeing my sugars come down and I lost 3 lbs. This is just one battle, but if these results keep up, I see this investment into Dr. Bernstein's program is a small price to pay for nutritional and healthy control."
1755.3."DIabetic book The Best Diabetic books are 30 Day Diabetes Cure from Lifestyle Center of America and the Cook book that you can purchase with it-- All Vegetarian or Dr. Neil Bernard's Diabetes Book Reverse Diabetes Now"
1756.3."Not much of a solution In my opinion not much of a solution. I was not impressed at all. I learned more from a small book I got from the dietician at the hospital than I did this book."
1757.5."The Type 2 Diabetes Answer. Of the five books that I've read on diabetes, this is the one that has all the answers. I've been on Dr. Bernsteins blood sugar normalization and weight loss program for 6 weeks and have lost 21 pounds, with no craving for carbohydrates!! The program works because the author(a Type 1 diabetic)hasworked out all the answers from personal experience."
1758.2."Good songs, but I have heard them all already The Dissapointed. Why do I need demos of all the songs already on Apple Venus 1. Let's bring on Apple Venus 2, after all, isn't that what we were promised?"
1759.2."thumbs down I don't actually own this album, but I did buy Apple Venus, and I'll say this: I hope that this album has the charm that that album lacked. I've never been so disappointed with an XTC album. Why would one buy an album of the exact same songs, except in demo form? A shoddy attempt to extract money, it seems. Shame on you, XTC!"
1760.2."Lame Recipes are a bit strange and not easy to follow. I wouldn't recomment this book at this time for anyone serious about cooking."
1761.3."The Century Cookbook It was interesting to read how our ancestors wrote out their recipes. Some of them were interesting I must admit. Some I can never see myself ever wanting to make much less eat.times and tastes certainly do change."
1762.2."These chip The price is right and these mugs have a great shape for easy handling. I wish I could say buy these, But...the rims chip very easily. Someone else stated this in their review should of followed their advice."
1763.4."Tea every morning I've been making my morning tea in these mugs for several years (no problem with pouring boiling water into them yet), and my mate has been using them occasionally for beer for just as long.They work well for tea or beer - the thick glass and the raised foot help keep liquids at the right temperature, and sixteen ounces is a bottle or a long-steeping teabags worth.My only problem with these is that the rims chip in the dishwasher. I dont' know if that's just my dishwasher, or because I put them next to heavy Arcoroc glasses, but I've found three so far with a slice taken out of the edge. (Which I then smooth down with a diamond wand). Anchor-hocking actually redesigned these to have a less flared lip a couple of years ago, so they may know about this problem. (The new ones chip too, just not as often)."
1764.2."fragile.. fragile....very fragile... I've had 6 of them for 1 month and one of them got lips chiped out already. (which one of the reviewer already commented that it happens often with these mug). It was sadly tossed out and now I'm worried they will eventually all dissapear out of my kitchen.Keep them apart from each other when you wash them. The slightest touch will chip it out unexpectedly.BTW: You can buy them individually at Bed and Bath Beyond for less price."
1765.5."Excellent mugs, my guests all agree I have had 12 of these 16 oz. mugs for some time now and think they are the best. Have had no chips, but am careful that no glasses touch other items in my dishwasher. I have given these for gifts and the recipients have asked for more of them for xmas next year. Thanks for an excellent product."
1766.2."Nice Basic Mug I like the size and style of these mugs, they go with anything and look like they'll last a long time.--- EDITED REVIEW --- Long term? not very durable. All but one have broken."
1767.3."Cheap looking but sturdy and does its job I was expecting better quality mugs than these(sort of like Snapple drink bottles). Also note that these mugs are a lot bigger in person so beware if you don't have big cabinet space. My husband said, they are sturdy and will hold your coffee and tea. Had I seen them in person, I wouldn't have purchased them. One thing I like about these mugs is its lovely shape."
1768.3."very attractive but not dishwasher safe These also break when placed in the dish drainer too energetically. I wish this size and shape came in stainless steel (with a lid like a Chinese tea covered tea mug but without any plastic or silicone seals that can soak up dishwasher detergent.)"
1769.1."Core Sports Performance A complete disappointment and waste of time. The narrator couldn't seem less interested; almost as though bothered by the project. Look somewhere else for a sports hypnosis cd."
1770.5."As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson. I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work."
1771.5."impressive book on a ghastly battle I enjoyed this book very much. I got it as a gift and have now brought a copy to give to someone else. It is very, very thorough, which makes it ideal for academics, but it is also easy for enthusiasts like me to understand and get absorbed in. And I did. Even though I naturally knew how the Stalingrad battle ended I still felt gripped by the dreadful story as it unfolded. Mr Hayward managed to make the events understable and the characters believable. I felt their frustration and their pain and their growing feelings of failure and terrible disappointment. This book goes well alongside Beavor's equally important study of the battle. Stalingrad enthusiasts simply MUST own copies of both, especially as Hayward's is the first to explain air operations (and brilliantly) and Beavor's is the first to look at the fate of the ordinary soldiers from both sides."
1772.5."A well written and informative book I read this book as part of a study I am doing into war on the Eastern Front.I found the book to be excellently researched and well written. For those who are interested in military history and in particular German Military history, I would say it's a must on any good bookshelf"
1773.5."I'm keen on Luftwaffe books and this is amongst the best. I agree with what esteemed Professor Richard Overy said in his review of this book: ""This is a model of its kind, which ought to set an agenda for the reconstruction of the air narrative in this and other theatres in the greatest of wars."" But I will go further; this book isn't only or even mainly a narrative. It's a powerfully strong piece of operational-level analysis. It is written in a lively and captivating way, which makes the density of analysis easy to cope with. I rate this work very highly."
1774.5."AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation. I heartily recommended this book."
1775.4."a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read."
1776.3."One sided A mediocre historian. Most of the facts he quotes based on one diary. For whatever reasons he trusts more the Nazi published facts and numbers then Soviets. The good news is that unlike the other books he describes in detail the Luftwaffe war."
1777.2."Sufi is inSUFIcient Seeking more knowledge of Sufism was my main reason for reading Catching the Thread. The description of Sufism was too scattered over the chapters for me to put the pieces together in a satisfying way. Just one chapter summarizing the basics would have made the difference. The amount of dream material was excessive. Why not just a few extensive case examples. It is impossible for me to judge the quality of the dream interpretation, given the limited information on the dreamers. Most of the applications of Jungian concepts seemed appropriate to me. For those unfamiliar with Jungian psychology, this book serves as a useful introduction."
1778.1."Not authentic The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, what is being taught on this tape is not authentic Argentine Tango. Not even close. It's ballroom tango. There is a huge difference: in music, style, steps, posture, etc... Don't be fooled by ballroom instructors trying to teach Argentine Tango. The only authentic instruction available on the market comes from authentic Argentine instructors from Buenos Aires."
1779.5."Fun Learning to Dance After receiving both of the Librero's tapes (The Big Band Swing and The Latin and Argentine Tango) as a gift, my husband and I cannot believe how easy it has been to learn to dance from them. Neither of us were dancers and Blanche and Emilio have made it fun and very simple for us to learn. Now we can dance all of the dances that we always wanted to, plus have a good time practicing with our friends. We also enjoy the music CDs that were part of the package, as well as the cue cards."
1780.2."Much ado about latin ballroom tango This version of tango is not argentine. It is ballroom latin american whatever you call it. Very misleading to call it argentine tango. But if you like ballroom dancing, maybe this video is for you."
1781.5."Great for Beginners! I am an intermediate dancer in some dances, and a beginner in others. I found the Librero's Dance Series (both the Big Band and Latin) very helpful in providing and overall understanding of the similarities and differences of all the popular dances. Their Argentine Tango section would be specially good for beginners. Most videos I have seen on this dance can be frustrating and overwhelming. The music CD is not very inspiring but the tempos are very good for practice and it is convenient. I definitely recommend the Librero's Series, particularly for the Beginner dancer."
1782.2."too dark to see the instructors. this video has a lot of dances for learning but each dance has only 3 steps so dont expect so much from this teaching video. if you want more than 3 steps then buy videos exclusively for a particular dance. this video will just wet your appetite but will not fill your hunger. also, the background setting of this video is very dark as if you are inside a dark night club so you cannot see the footsteps of the teachers because both of them were wearing black pants that blend with the dark background, terrible! plus the teachers teach from the side of the camera and sometimes facing the camera. this is not the ideal way to teach dance in a video. the teachers should be back to the camera so you can follow their footwork. for the money they charge for this video is not worth it."
1783.2."Tapes don't work for me. There are a few things I didn't like about the tape. Firstly, the price is too high. Secondly tape is inconvenient for a spoiled by technology user. It's much easier to work with DVDs and their menus. And lastly, I realized that I'd rather spend 70 dollars on 4 monthly group lessons and learn basic steps and routines of one dance then try to master all by myself while watching a tape."
1784.5."The best series available for parents I buy Wiley's guide every year and always find her to be right on the money when it comes to rating the rides, recommending hotels, and giving tips on extras like how and where to meet the characters. What separates this book from the other Disney guides is that it's realistic....the unoffical guide lays out a itinerary that would kill anyone with kids and the official guide is all sugary and light, never telling you how to handle the crowds and the heat and all the other things that are just a factor when you're at Disney World. Wiley hits the middle ground - she's positive and obviously knows (and loves) her stuff but she'll also give you the facts."
1785.5."excellent I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go. The book was right on about every detail. I especially like the ride advice for little ones and the hotel recommendations. If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!"
1786.2."this book was a big dissapointment I found this book to be very out of date. I can't count how many times I read ""coming in 2000"" and then no info on the subject. I didn't expect this from a book written for 2001. I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money."
1787.5."Geography Book arrived in good contition as described and in the time indicated. Very happy with the service. I would use them again."
1788.5."fantastic This is a wonderful book with bright cute illustrations and a good story. We got one with stickers for Christmas, it was a nice bonus. My son read it 250+ times in the past few years, he is growing up but the book never gets old or boring :o) thank you"
1789.3."Enjoyable book -- very touching The characters in this book have backgrounds which influence them as the story unfolds. I especially found it interesting to see life as a captive from a child's point of view throughout the story since Dede's son was held captive along with her. I found the ending of the story to be very touching (warm fuzzies). Read it and you'll know what I mean."
1790.3."A bit disappointed This is the first book of Cassie Edwards I have read and I am a bit disappointed. I always liked to read about American native people but even for me ( and I am living faraway from States) many things look untrue and strange. First, the picture on the front page - it looks that Thunder Heart has hair on his face. As I know Indians do not have to shave theirselves. Second, I think that such a worrier and chief as Thunder Heart was could not be involved with so many unimportant things, even if he is very,very,very in love. However, the most unusual character is Bill. I believe that such a man as Bill is, could not change so much. Who says that in the end everything must be just fine?"
1791.1."Nice Title! It's rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in history (Styx: Pieces of Eight). And to Mr. ""Please push sales"" who wrote the other ""review"": I bet your cover art isn't QUITE as good as the incredible Hypgnosis masterpiece of the Styx album. ;-)"
1792.1."Save your money! I received this software as ""bonus"" with Photo Explosion Delux. It's terrible. Was easy to create the slideshow and it looked great on my computer. Tried it on 2 DVDs and it didn't play. Tried to re-record it on a CD-RW and it still didn't work! It did run on my husband's laptop, but out of 6 computers I tried it on at work it only was recognized on 1! Very frustrating software. SAVE YOU MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
1793.3."Solid work! This is a solid piece of work by a very good band. A few really good songs and the rest are OK. This is a good purchase for fans of German pop."
1794.4."Spiderman Blu-Ray Trilogy Spider-Man - The High Definition Trilogy (Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 / Spider-Man 3) [Blu-ray] WE ARE TALKING SPIDERMAN HERE AND ON BLU-RAY IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING AND ENTERTAINING. NOT TRUE MOVIE FAN AND COLLECTOR SHOULD BE MISSING THIS SET IN THEIR COLLECTION. A MUST HAVE TO OWN."
1795.4."Absolutely Worth It !!!!! Just as you might have seen in the theatre, BD provides better sound and vision for all the viewers, especially HD resolution does come in handy compared to the old cable TV channels. Somehow I didn't give it a 5-star it's because the box looks kind of damaged outside. The fact that I want to keep it a collection, which a rough look on the ouside doesn't adore me too much. Well...I guess that's the only flaw I could come up with. Besides that, videos quality and sound look just fine to me."
1796.2."Wait for the ""final"" boxset to be released This DVD Trilogy box contains the two-disc editions of SM 1&2 and the single-disc edition of Spidey 3. However, 1 and 3 are available separately in 3-disc sets, and I'd be surprised if 2 wasn't given the 3-disc treatment right before Christmas. So, when the 3-disc editions of all 3 movies are available in one box (think Ultimate Matrix Collection), then that will be the one to buy. This box can be skipped."
1797.2."Spiderman 3 was horrible. Personally I would NOT buy the trilogy because spiderman 3 was horrible, 1 & 2 where great though. 3 not so good!"
1798.2."Why am I re-buying this again? Great picture quality, cool, and Blu-Ray is the premier format for all of its seamless feature interaction, and high storage capacity for more bonus material.... except Spider-man 1 and 2 have no special features (aside from the 2.1 stuff). Great use of space, thanks for all those perks, BR.So, I have to wonder, is it really worth the $70 to pick this up again?"
1799.3."great but disc was scratched I got this as a Valentines Day gift for my fiance he LOVES spiderman. However the 2nd disc wasn't packaged right & was loose inside the case resulting in scratches! So of course it doesn't play right. Was a bit disappointed."
1800.5."Great Seller This 3 package DVD arrived in perfect condition and rather quickly. Had no problems with this seller, very pleased. Always would recommend you to buy from this seller."
1801.5."Excellect Value and Fast Service When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products."
1802.2."Blu Ray for 1& 2 has none of the DVD extras. Spider-Man 1 & 2 Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the DVDs. Why would a studio release two extraordinary FX films of this magnitude and incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras? If you're a fan of behind the scenes content, hold onto your DVDs.Movie - A+. Blu-Ray value for Spider-Man 1&2 - FAIL."

1804.1."Poor quality of wrapping I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."
1805.1."Sipder-man ""The High Definition Trilogy"" [Blu-ray] only works on PS3 I agree the comment from reviewer GWIRTH ""ginnyww"". Somehow these Sipderman blu-rays are not norm. They can only play on PS3. No luck with Samsung blu-ray players, not work with Sony blu-ray players either. Manufacturer needs to check what's going on. I also checked two sets of Sipderman blu-rays, one set from Fry's electronics, another set from Amazon, same problem, so that is not random disc defects."
1806.1."WANT REFUND! The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work."
1807.3."we've all seen the movies tobey maguire as peter parker is just as bad as elijah wood as frodo baggins. good movies dampened by the leads but strengthened by the rest of the cast."
1808.1."this is not a region 1 set I bought this set for my husband and brother for Christmas last year then we ended up buying a different set for the movie cash for the new movie. I went to sell this set at used movie retailer and they informed me it was from overseas and possibly a bootleg. WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!"
1809.2."Toby McGuyre Spider-Man suffers in comparison Lets state the obvious - Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man is light years ahead of Toby McGuyre. Toby is nerdy and homely to the point of neurosis. Andrew's Spidey is bookish, but also skateboards in his high school's halls. Agressive, bold and self-assured. Taller, leaner, way better looking; Andrew's reboot of the franchise makes these 3 earlier McGuyre Spider-Man films suffer by comparison"
1810.4."Great effects, story can be shorten. Story is way too long, and too many unneccessary scenes that not helping the story at all. It doesn't seem like a Spider-Man anymore. But the effects and fight scenes are awesome, so it balance out."
1811.4.Great value I got this for 40 something dollars and it was a great vale for my pocket, plus the great pic quality
1812.1."Not a real collection boxset. I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
1813.5."Spider-Man Trilogy Received promptly - unfortunately I ordered the blu-ray and this is not what my son-in-law wanted. I trust the return will be equally easy."
1814.5."I imagine it's good I bought this as a gift for a kid who's a Spider Man fan. He really enjoys it, but I'm not a super hero fan myself."
1815.1."Perfect if I Lived In Europe Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address. Amazon refunded my money with no issue."
1816.2."Movies good but set is very cheap in quality Felt like a cheap knockoff. Definitely works well for people that just want the movies but no money or effort was spent on the container."
1817.4."Great trilogy Spiderman I, II, and III, were very entertaining and kept the grandkids entertained. The entire family enjoyed the films, popcorn and drinks."
1818.5."Great buy! This was exactly what I was looking for. I have the trilogy on Blu-Ray but my son is a huge spider-man fan and only has a dvd player in his room so as I gift I wanted to get this for him so he would be able to watch it whenever he wanted."
1819.5."Wish I could get it locally The one supermarket chain in our area that carries Quaker Essentials Oat Bran cereal closed our local store. We can get it by driving around 60 miles round trip, but that is inconvenient and wasteful of gas.I could substitute another cereal for myself, but my peach-faced lovebird loves it, and so far will accept no substitute. She eats some, and dunks some in her water bowl, then piles it on a perch. The result is a ""cereal sculpture."" Why she does this, I don't know.I ordered it through an Amazon vendor and received excellent service, but I wish the shipping wasn't so darn expensive."
1820.5."How a religion is Born! This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!"
1821.1."linear thinking loud equals authority idotic to credit Robert Graves with inventing the Goddess. false authority. beware. sounds impressive but shoots self in foot repeatedly."
1822.2."will it never end!? Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job!"
1823.5."Review of Triumph of the Moon I have not finished reading the book. I have, however, found it hard to put down. It was engaging, comprehensive and enjoyable to read. I heard this book recommended by sales people in my city Halifax.It is without a doubt informative and accurate in the history of Witchcraft. I know it was preferred over other books on the history of Witchcraft."
1824.3."Neither earth-shattering, nor an easy read. When this book came in from the library, my first thought was, ""wow...finally...some serious scholarship on the subject."" And while this work is eminently cited in many books on its subject, it's neither an easy read nor particularly ground breaking in the arguments it makes and the history it provides.Now I should say I am no stranger to books published by academic presses, however, readability does matter to me and I just did not find it very accessible as a person overwhelmed in academic reading.In short, if someone was searching for a brief, realistic, and readable history of Wicca and Witchcraft, I would suggestBonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca, which covers much of the same ground (history of witchcraft in ancient, pre-modern, and modern times and the development of Wicca) in much more readable but still serious tone and style."
1825.4."Excellent work, shame about the typeset. This is a veyr detailed and informative history. However the paperback edition has miniscule print on low grade paper, so much so that it is hard to read for a long period of time. I would reccomend getting the hardback. The work itself is great and it's worth paying the extra to be able to read it without needing aspirin on standby."
1826.3."Got iMovie? As a Mac user, I can just say that this cable is essential for anyone who wants to utilize the syncing features of iMovie with a Sony Handycam. The USB connector that came packed with my HC40 was completely useless when trying to connect to iMovie.This is essentially the reason I can't give it a higher rating than three stars. It was definitely frustrating to find that after investing in such a decent personal-use camera, that Sony expected me to buy still more of their stuff to make it even connect with my computer. If I had to purchase it at the ridiculous Sony retail price, ""frustrating"" would've been too mild a descriptor, but Amazon's discount helped soften the insult.Beyond that, I can't say a whole heckuva lot about it - it's a cable, after all. Ha!"
1827.2."Annoyingly necessary profit generator for Sony Works as described. I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable, making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive. It's smart for Sony to conduct business this way, but only in order to earn profit in the short term. You can bet I won't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future, now knowing that this is how they run their business."
1828.3."Too bad Sony just wants more of your money This is just another way for Sony to make another $35 on the purchase of their Video Camera. Imagine my surprise finding out that I had to purchase a separate cable in order to create DVD's from my DV camera. As far as the cable itself goes, it is fine. But, it sure would give Sony more favorable talk on my part if they just included the cable when I buy the camera."
1829.5."Worked just like it was supposed to This product worked exactly as it was supposed to. I had tried using the cable that came with the camera (USB cord) and found out exactly what many others had said on blogs.....IT DOESN'T WORK!!!Once I got this cable, it worked perfectly. I was able to easily download video from my camera to my computer. The only frustration I had was that I would rather have paid a little more for the camera and gotten this cable with it in the first place."
1830.1."Cable not what it is sold as Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It doesn't do it. I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that. I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better. They then charged me 15% to take the cable back. You would be smart to shop elsewhere. They don't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge."
1831.2."Undecided - Be cautious It worked for about a month. Even when it did work it was a hit or miss thing. I had to fool with it for a while. Maybe it was because I bought the cheapest one available. Maybe it was a knock-off, who knows? I have yet to try it on another computer to rule out it not being the cord. Fair warning."
1832.2."Upgrade computer If you have a new computer or maybe newer that 2003 this cable will work if you are working with one older than that like me it doesn't work. So now I have this wonderful cable and waiting to get an upgraded computer to match."
1833.1."what a rip off, sony's using customers as cashcows, get the cable from apple instead for only $29! I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony."
1834.4."good dampener with good hitting sound its a good dampener. I bought it for my head racket which is now 6yrs oldthe reason i bought it was because my racket was getting these little annoying noises when i serveso i tried it on and now the sounds are gone and its also very good for the price"
1835.4."Different Colors than Shown, but works fine The product photo shows one black and one red dampener, but TennisExpress shipped to me two white dampeners. I was actually hoping for the red and black ones, just to match my racquet, but I do know that is only cosmetic. The dampeners function just fine."
1836.4."good dampener, has never fallen out Works as advertised; best shock absorber I've used. Silences the annoying 'poing' sound from the racquet, and has never fallen out, even on a direct mishit. Four stars because they are a little expensive for what you get."
1837.5."Awesome glasses, would buy again. Very fast shipping and excellent transaction with Amazon. Couldn't be happier with these glasses, had them five years now and they are still wonderful."
1838.1."Phantom Glasses - Beware! Ordered on September 24, 2005 -- delivery now estimated by Amazon ""sometime"" after December 24, 2005. Three months (or more) for delivery seems excessive. Amazon should be ashamed for treating customers this way."
1839.1."Flatout is flat This game has some good qualities, but the pure racing person will have issues, as you gain $ for running into objects and cars, which blows. You are in a race and losing, so blast your car and everyone around you to get $$ for the next race. Realistic? Not. They don't even have a view from inside the car, it is a bumper view with no part of the car visible. The interface with arrow buttons is bad, and you can't even race online, just by LAN. In short, stick with Leadfoot or DTRSC and you will be at least $40 better off.jc"
1840.5."A defining book. This book would be effective for grief therapy and for teaching about life cycles. It specifically answers the question: What is a lifetime?My daughter, age 4, had a lot of questions about death. She was most especially interested in finding out when her ""dying day"" would be. This book seemed to help her understand that everyone's lifetime is special to them. I wanted her to understand that because someone else died it doesn't mean her death is imminent. A common fear among the young.An exquisitely illustrated and plainly written book, it speaks clearly to the children about a complicated subject. I highly recommend it for all home and school libraries for ages three and up. It should be used as part of a comprehensive set of books on biological and familial concepts as it is not meant to answer all of a child's questions on life cycles, grief, death or dying."
1841.3."A ""matter-of-fact"" book about lifetimes and death. This book is beautifully illustrated, and it explains the facts of life and death in a very direct and unsentimental way: all creatures have a lifetime, then they die. The book discusses the lifetimes of different living creatures, from insects who only live a few days, to large mammals who live many years. It describes people as living for ""sixty or seventy years, sometimes even more."" That is a little scary for a child whose grandparents are already way past those ages and still in great health. ""Lifetimes"" explains the concepts of lifespan and death, but does not offer comfort for those who fear death or are grieving. I recommend the book ""Gentle Willow"" for those who want a gentler, more comforting story, that is no less true to fact."
1842.3."Very gentle introduction, but awkward at times I looked around for a book to help my wife and I discuss the concept of death with our 2 year old when his grandma passed away recently. Most of the books in the kid section were way too advanced. This is the only one I found that I was comfortable even trying to read to him. After a few reads he seemed to have a good understanding of the book.However the book could be improved in a couple of ways. First the cadence of the writing and starting a thought on one page and finishing it on the next can make it awkward to read, especially if you read slowly and talk about the illustrations. Secondly there is an injured butterfly shown early in the book who has died. But later on there is a healthy butterfly shown - this confuses my child as he thinks the butterfly got better. This undermines the message of the first butterfly, that sometimes things get so badly hurt that they cannot be repaired."
1843.4."Great book This book helped my 5 year old a little. We need to read it a couple times. Thanks, it helped. He was concerned about dying."
1844.3."Good book with a few problems This is a good book in many ways, but with a few issues that may prevent me from sharing it with my children.I like the straight-forward unsentimental approach to the topic. However at one point it states that people live for ""sixty or seventy years, sometimes even more."" As another reviewer noted, ""That is a little scary for a child whose grandparents are already way past those ages and still in great health."" It's also a bit off the mark, given that life expectancy in the US is close to 80, so 70 or 80 years might be more accurate...but I would have avoided putting a number on it myself.I also agree with other reviewers that the picture of the dead butterfly, followed by one of a live butterfly of the same species is confusing. And, finally, the splinter-removal picture is kind of scary and the child has a haunted look on his face.I recommend the book ""In a Nutshell,"" by Joseph Anthony."
1845.3."I read this as a child... My Mother read this book to me as a child after my Father passed away when I was two years old. I have to say that the book was good at helping me understand death, but that the picture of the little boy with the splinter haunted me for years. I don't know what it was, but from that moment on, this book was known to me as ""The little boy book.""Just a warning for some parents that have children that may be fightened easily."
1846.1."Break too easily My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."
1847.2."Very ordinary performances, mediocre video quality The musical performances here are quite dull. There is nothing wrong about them except that the musicians seem to be simply doing their job and nothing else. If I had paid good money for this concert in person, I would have been highly disappointed. The video quality is even worse. The DVD is cheap but not cheap enough to justify its purchase."
1848.2."Difficult product I bought this DVD for the Mozart Symphony #35. However, it is very difficult to access the work. I finally figured out that the only way to do it is to fast forward through the final movement of the Lebrun Concerto. This problem was in evidence on several different DVD players one of which can track DVDs with any region code. There are some wonderful performances on this series. Too bad the engineering is so poor."
1849.2."pitchshifter is not the same! When i first heard about deviant, i thought it would be something great (judging by previous records and the way Ps developed in their musical style). But after finally listening thru it i suddenly realised PS was trying to go mainstream. Their new CD is so much alike with Korn or limp bizkit music it was terryifing. I couldn't understand why Ps chose to opt out of the electronics towards more punk/rock style. In general this CD has some good tracks (2 to be exact), but it not deliver the goods like the previous CD's did. I AM SORELY DISSAPOINTED!"
1850.2."What happened to Pitchshifter? The Pitchshifter sound that has been forged over their last 5 or so releases, culminating wonderfully with ""www.pitchshifter.com"" has here been stripped to a watered-down sound that could have come from any of 1,000 other bands who are wasting our time (and money) these days. The Pitchshifter formula of brutal guitars mixed with programed drums and other industrial and electronic affects was unlike anything else on the musical scene. That sound is completely gone on this CD--reducing their punishing onslaught to something that MTV would have little problem broadcasting. A very disappointing CD."
1851.5."PSI stilll rocks I eagerly anticipated the release of this album, knowing whatever came out of it would be excellent. Musically, it was a dramatic change when compared to other albums such as pitchshifter.com, or infotainment? I like the somewhat mellow approach to many songs, but dont get discouraged, they still have the heavier stuff like ""keep it clean,"" ""dead battery,"" and ""wafer thin."" (my personal favorites) They just keep getting better and better after every release. people complain that they are going mainstream, they change for the times, and what not. At first they resembled one of my favorite bands, ministry, but look at them now, they have stepped away from that, and now have their own unique blend of techno, rock, industrial. they are on a plain all by themselves. lyrically and musically, they cannot be outdone by any rock, or industrial band out at the time. This album is their best to date. PSI ROCKS"
1852.2."Bratz Helmet When I ordered this product, I didn't see a size chart and I was sent a size that is not suitable for the purpose intended."
1853.4."Works well I just bought it a few days ago. Doesn't do miracles but the suction is great, works well on both carpet and hardwood floors, the noise level is reasonable. The only disadvantage is sort of cheap plastic construction but for the $89.99 I paid for it I can live with it :)"
1854.5."Exceeded Expectaitions! The CD was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived early. It was in pristine condition. I'm very thankful that I found this vendor as this was a very rare CD. I will use this vendor again."
1855.4."Great follow up to From One. Ra is really underrated rock band. They have great melodies, good arganments, middle eastern vibe here and there, a singer who is really influenced by Sting and the Police. They even cover one of their songs. If you dig Breaking Benjamin or Alter Bridge, this band is for you. Every song is great, really no weak tracks. I highly recommend this cd."
1856.3."Good but not great I agree with the other reviewers when they say From One is a better album. Don't get me wrong, this is a decent effort, but I feel like if you were to rate all these songs on a scale of 1-10, almost all these songs would be around a 7. ...Good, but not high enough to the point that the disc will still be getting regular play in your CD player 6 months to a year from now."
1857.4."Old, but new I enjoyed this album. At first glance it appears that it is your standard post-1990's rock album. But after a good listen, you realize that they have succeeded in forging a rather good and unique album. It's well done and has a good shelf life due to its distinctive sound."
1858.4."Good cd While ra's first cd is alot heavier, this one is more laid back. I like both heavy and lighter styles of music. I would have to say that this cd is better musically than the first one.visionclothingco.com"
1859.4."Takes a few listens... Ra is a very interesting band to watch grow. Their first release (From One) was an excellent debut that showed off their potential. Its an album that can immediately be digested and have you loving them in no time. With ""Duality"" the band is still lyrically strong, if not stronger. However, instrumental-wise, the band has fallen into a very generic hole that they need to climb themselves out of. Not to say the instrumental on this album is awful, no, not by any means. It just doesn't stand out nearly as much as their debut album had. I've had this album since the first week it came out. There are a few tracks that you can immediately get into, mostly on the first half, but the rest will fall away from your first listen. Over time though you will grow to appreciate the rest of this album, I did at least.8/10"
1860.5."Another RA Gem! For those of you that read my review for ""From One,"" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. This is an excellent CD, though toned down ""From One,"" it still rocks. You can't go wrong with ordering BOTH at the same time (that's what I did). BTW, I think RA does ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" BETTER than Police originally did it!!! ;^)"
1861.3."Ra I loved the first cd, but this one is to regular or genric. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these songs... Each song is similar to the next one, the only time i got chills was when he sang...and in this cd all the does is sing uniquely for a second then back to chrous....*sigh* what happened? The songs in this newer album are okay, i liked the lyrics, its just missing that special something...oh well."
1862.4."More of the same, which is pretty good. This album, of course, builds on the themes of the first one - Sahaj has a lot to say, and isn't done saying it - with plenty of the same texture and style that made the first album so listenable. Lyrically surprising, you may find yourself coming to an unexpected point when the song turns out to have something very different to say than first impressions indicated. Another reviewer had mentioned that they seem to be stuck with a single pattern of songwriting structure, and I can't disagree, but I'm willing to cut them some slack for a sophomore album. We'll see if they get a bit more adventurous for the third album."
1863.2."From Zero to Unfortunately, Duality When I first heard Ra's ""From Zero"" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken. The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more."
1864.4."AWESOME, Not sure why 4 stars when I put 5 I found this Band while looking up information on Trixter and found PJ Farley in the band. Listened to RA on their website and bought this CD the same day. I have not found a band lately that took me away like RA.I have not heard the first album but it is next on my list, since I got Duality today and have not stopped listening to it!!!RA ROCKS!!!!"
1865.3."That'll do Ra, That'll do Keeping in mind that Ra isn't too highly complex, I think it is safe to say that this was a pleasant surprise. Still even though I feel that they need to get the gears moving in order to escape the fate of all Nu-Metal bands. They are a very well balanced band that brings some good lyrics and musicianship and with the remake of ""Every Little Thing She Does is Magic"", I was pleased for the money spent."
1866.2."17 years old and it shows Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn't ordered ""Strength Ball Training"" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. This book seems very amateurish by today's standards. It's a thin paperback with hand-drawn sketches. Maybe this was considered okay back in 1991, but this is 2008. SBT gives you all of the exercises in this book plus many more, updated with recent training science background, illustrated with photographs of actual people, plus a DVD with videos illustrating many of the exercises! And it's the same price! Come on, get into this century. Amateur productions like this one just don't cut it anymore."
1867.4."good stuff great resource for anyone looking to add variety to medicine ball exercises, increase their overall explosiveness during intense physical activity."
1868.3.rap stuff!!! this album is ok,but the beats are weak!the lyrics and rap mechanics are great---but the album lacks in too many areas!!only recommended for desperate hip hop listeners!
1869.1."Not a scholarly book The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people."
1870.4."Required Reading for all Americans Let me be the first reviewer since 9/11 to weigh in on this valuable book. Every American reacted to the horrors of that day in their own personal way and many reflected on the secular foundations of our constitution but few people know the details of the struggle that went into the conception, the codification and the defense of our first amendment. The separation of church and state is the greatest source of our strength as a country; every American should know the struggle of Roger Williams, the history of the Southern Baptists, and the strong belief of our founding fathers in the freedom of choice regarding personal beliefs. All explained in this simple and scholarly book."
1871.1."Brain washing I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this book as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up. They simply state they they have forgone the traditional footnotes and that we should believe them just because they have a PHD. I know that if I were writing any type of paper for these gentlemen in college they would fail me if I didn't show where I got my information. Furthermore, There is a man in Texas who has the world's largest collection of artifacts from our founding fathers and he has loads of evidence which point to the extreme opposite. In fact he has a copy of bibles that were printed and distributed to every family in America through funding from Congress. I would encourage anyone who sees this to watch the documentary called ""MONUMENTAL"" by Kirk Cameron, exposes the truth about our constitution writers and points out the damage that books like these have caused to our society."
1872.1."Baseless, made up propaganda This is a book that is used in colleges across America, but contains almost no primary source quotes, no footnotes, no endnotes, and thus no scholarly support for any of it's assertions. Did the author even bother to read the founders' letters, speeches, published works, etc? Probably not, bc actual quotes from those who founded this country would really get in the way of their made up speculation, hearsay, and biased opinions masquerading as historical fact. Pathetic."
1873.1.the man from utah the movie was so blurry you could hardly see it,it wasnt verygood thank you carol meeks
1874.4."What happened to the Night World? I didn't like this book as much as the others. I still think it was good. But suddenly L. J. Smith sticks in a spirit from the in-between place. That has nothing to do with the Night World. It doesn't deal a lot with Gillian's witchcraft. In fact, she doesn't even know she's a witch until about the middle of the book. One thing I liked was Ash's cameo role as the knight in shining armor, coming to rescue the helpless human."
1875.2."Definitely not her best. Okay, this was the first Night World book that I read, and it seemed pretty good. But compared to LJS's other books, this is pathetic. I don't know, most of her books are great, but really! Gillian is a weak character who is shallow enough to think that popularity is all that matters. David is boring and predictable, and I think Angel (or Gary) would have been much better for her. I wouldn't go for David because he acts all protective and stupid. Also, it makes the whole soulmate thing boring and not dangerous because the lost witch (Gillian) doesn't even know she is a witch at first. I think that LJS's other books are a lot better. ~Ondine"
1876.4."Pretty Awesome!! This book, was in my opinion, pretty good. Not one of her best, but it was good. I really liked the story, and I really liked the characters. To me, the story had a different meaning, than most people had seen. If you read between the lines, you see that this is what a lot of people hope for. To be popular, to be perfect in every aspect, and to have power. I really liked this book, and reccomend it to anyone who likes Lisa Jane Smith, or anyone who likes books about ""Creatures Of The Night"" :)"
1877.3."I thought it wasn't as good as the other Night World books It wasn't as good as the other books in the series. I enjoyed Daughters of Darkness the most so far. I have bought every Night World novel that has been released and can't wait for new ones."
1878.3."don't really know This book is my least favorite of all tjhe N.W. books. It has almost nothing to do with the night world. Very disapointing. I think that David is really stupid and Gillian should be soulmates with Angel. Now that would've been cool."
1879.2."Everlasting Love--what else? This book was not the best. It was boring and the characters were underdeveloped. I liked the idea that Gillian WASN'T gorgeous, rich, and plain perfect, but in a snap she became the typical LJ Smith character. I love the idea of soulmates and everything, but I think these kids find their soulmates too easily, and how come everyone in LJ Smith books have to be SO perfect? Maybe if they were not so gorgeous--really how many gorgeous people are there in the world who are ""perfect"" on top of that? If you want to read LJ Smith, read the trilogies or even the other Night World books because this book reads like LJ Smith was getting desperate for a ""new"" idea."
1880.3."Not the best I was dissapointed with this book. It is my least favorite of the Night World books so far (I have read up to Black Dawn) I think L. J. Smith can write and has written much better books(ie: Daughters of Darkness, Secret Vampire, and The Chosen)"
1881.1."I can't belive LJS wrote this I am a huge LJS fan, I have read almost all of her books well over 10 times except this one. It was so boring I really disliked to book. It didn't have anything to do with the NW until the book was almost done, and Gillian was so pathetic and whimpy. David.... I really didn't like his character at all."
1882.5."I don't know what is everyone so disappointed about This was my first LJS book, recommended by a friend, who is a book critic. I was hooked on LJS books ever since. I have read every one of her books and have found them excellent."
1883.2."This book wasn't near as good as the others Gillian came off as a wimp. Angel was ok. They should have made Gillian seem more like a real girl and not someone from a soap opera."
1884.3."It was good but what happened to the best? I love the series, I love the author, I love all her books, but what happened. It was a good book and worth reading but it needed more romance, more danger, more Night World,and definitely MORE SUSPENCE. I just bought the book to add to my selection but i think she should stick with what she does best....Night World not ghost stories."
1885.2."This book is messed up In this book, not only is there no real ""love"" scenes, but to top it off, the girl's cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate. Granted, Angel is dead, but he's still related to her and definately should NOT be trying to catch his own cousin. Ewww. To top off the wrongness that is this book, there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff. Also, this is a 'coming of age' story about how being popluar isn't the most important. I love every other Night World book, but this is retarded."
1886.3."Gillian and Angel---Dark Angel I just discovered the Dark World and I have to say that I love them, but Dark Angel was not my favorite, there was nothing to do with the Dark World at all until the very end and I just sat there and kept asking myself...""what does this have to do with the Dark World"" Love the rest of her books but this one was not the best."
1887.3."Ths was not quite what I had expected. This book had nothing to do with the Nigt World. I was disapointed that it didn't have anything about soalmates or any Night World related subjects. I do not know why Smith would actually put it in the series. This was the only book in the series that actually got boring. If you want cool excitement and romance read Black Dawn or Secreat Vampire!"
1888.1."I can't believe she wrote this! LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one."
1889.5."Underrated This book is the ultimate revenge story. Sure Gillian is superficial but shes had a rough life and deserves to have her chance to shine in the spotlight. And all those readers who do not feel it fit in with the Night World must not have been very observant cuz her place in the Night World was hinted at quite a lot. And she does go to a witches store and she also trys to get in the black iris club once...besides it would be to formulaic if each book was wrapped tightly inside the Night World...each books show different levels of impact the Night World has...plus like all the nightworld books...this deals with a certain kinda topic...Secret Vampire was a girl who was dying and needed to be changed to live...soulmate covered reicarnation and this book delt with a near life experience. Its not the best of the series but its high up there on my list at least."
1890.1."Left-Wing Propaganda This old chestnut of a book should be put out of its misery. It's written with style and a tone of authority, but careful reading shows that it is hopelessly slanted. On every significant point which involves historical uncertainty or controversy, the authors unquestioningly accept the left-wing/labor point of view and cynically disparage or totally ignore any other interpretation. This is Labor's ""untold"" story because no other reputable historians have ever had the nerve to write such an openly propagandistic book. Academic labor historians who think this book is so wonderful are merely showing their left-wing ideological colors. There are much better and more objective accounts out there."
1891.5."Heavenly Music This is by far the most beautiful CD I have ever listened to. I love it so much I have given it as a gift to family friends and they all love it as much as I do and it has quickly become everyone's favorite. It is truly music to adore and nourish your sprite and soul. Aeoliah is a genius - I give this music my highest recommendation."
1892.4."Impressive One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD."
1893.4."The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book..."
1894.1."No stars but they all think they are and have stuff to say. You can be a rock star and not have a clue as to what haiku is. This book has been around. It has been the brunt of jokes in the haiku community. I can't say I know how to write a decent haiku but if you google, you WILL find some great haiku poets. PLEASE - if you don't have this book, keep it that way. It may have been a year but not a haiku one."
1895.1."Definitely NOT haiku - poetry? Maybe... This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
1896.1."The only stars is the rocker You make it in rock and you think you can do it all. This book proves you can't. It is a truly poor excuse for a collection of haiku and it is particularly offensive because there are those who will buy it thinking it the real thing. Do yourself a favor and buy Higginson. You can look at this in a few minutes in the bookstore. It might be good for advanced classes in ""don't let this happen to you!"""
1897.1."It's the end of haiku as we know it... This is what has become of haiku in English- and it is all bad. Haiku in America in general is vastly misunderstood and each of the verses in this volume show it. Some have three lines, some do not, some have kigo, some do not. By the looks of this, one can deduce that these ""poets"" gleamed their knowledge of haiku from Kerouac (another haiku fraud) rather than Basho. This is just an experiment really, conducted by a circle of friends who jotted down their thoughts and sent them to one another. Please, please avoid this title if you really care about or want to learn about haiku. Amazon should allow ""0"" stars when rating items such as this!"
1898.1."poorly written nonsense The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book. He strings together repetitive descriptions of ""unexplained"" events, without coherent narrative or structure.The book is filled with ludicrous claims about what ""scientists know"" or ""studies have shown."" Of course there's no support for the claims.Don't waste your time on this book."
1899.2."Boring Garbage. The author is no different from the other 50,000 lunatics running around the country chasing lights. The only difference is this guy wrote a book. Watch the X Files instead.."
1900.3."just too all over the place The movie condensed (and changed as movies often do) the book. The book is sort of about this and about all kinds of stuff. It just kept losing me."
1901.1."Dull, Disjointed Two hundred pages into the book, and I'm still waiting for a cogent theme to emerge. Poorly written, poorly documented, and thin...in other words, perfect fodder for a commercial movie."
1902.1."Bogus...bunk...B-A-loney I enjoy reading about ""unexplained phenomena"". I really do. I love ""real"" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a ""true believer"" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. ""Wow,"" I thought. ""That could almost be construed as logical."" However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: ""But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time.""*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor."
1903.2."Disappointing The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one. Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to ""The Mothman Prophecies."" John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves. I was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black) behaving badly.I've given this singularly overrated book two stars, rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years ago."
1904.2."repetitive, lackluster I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"
1905.3."Decent book While this book contained some interesting stories about ""aliens"" and abduction scenarios, it is also very disjointed and out of step. Keel bounces from one unrelated story to the next, and I can't for the life of me understand his ridiculous ""energy beings"" theory on UFO's; from what I could gather of his ideas, he makes people who think the dark side of the moon is inhabited by aliens seem almost mainstream. Despite my frustration with Mr. Keel's writing style and theories, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in the paranormal."
1906.2."mothman-putting the loose ends together? I found the movie leading in many directions....Why was John's wife appearing in Point Pleasent? Was this the mothman? Why did John appear for Gordon 3 nights at 2:30 a.m? These questions were never answered in the movie.... or did I miss something? The movie ran long for me, maybe because of the loose ends. I could be wrong, you decide. Go see the movie......"
1907.2."Very Detailed and Never Ending I usually like the books better than the movie. It is an interesting book although it touches on everything and seems to repeat itself time after time. The movie focused more on the actual ""mothman"" and I felt the book just mentioned it among many other things. This book should have been named ""Mothman, Men In Black, UFOS, and the Kitchen Sink."" I was glad to be done with this book. Don't waste your money on this book, check it out from the library."
1908.5."Outstanding UFO book Having read at least 50 books on UFOs and related phenomena, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" has become one of my favorites along with those of Jacques Vallee. This classic is a must read and reaches the unpopular but most likely true conclusion that UFOs aren't from outer space but are psychic in nature."
1909.3."Fairly informative I found this book to be fairly interesting, but at times the reader becomes bogged-down in the history of these sightings..the book would have been better reading had it focused more on a personal level and investigated the more personal aspects of how these unique sightings changed people in that town. If you expect to find the movie within the book, FORGET it, it is NOT there. Overall, lukewarm reading."
1910.2."Where's the beef or Mothman in this case? There is a lot about the 60s' that for obvious reasons, I have forgotten but I do remember that there were a lot of Instamatic cameras and 8 mm movie cameras around so I guess my question is: Why are there no pictures of this thing? I believe the good people of Point Pleasant saw something as there were at least 100 reported sightings of ""Mothman"" and I simply cannot accept the author's statement that all those camera's that the newspeople took along failed to work for one reason or the other.The movie was excellent but then it was not based entirely on this wacky book which is written in kind of a random fashion and is not all that good in the first place. ""Show me the pictures."""
1911.2."Not What I'd Hoped For I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago. Instead, this meandering book comprises ""hick"" UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman, and Keel's trust-me-I- know-what-I'm-talking-about theories and explanations. I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men (in black) behaving badly. With little to recommend it (and aside from providing some details on the Mothman sightings, there's no other recommendation), ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a considerable disappointment."
1912.4."Interesting, but requires extra work on the part of the reader. As many of the other reviewers have said, this book isn't in chronological order nor does it put forth any kind of explanation for the mysterious events it describes - which I myself was rather disappointed by. You can catch glimpses of what Keel might be thinking from his comments throughout - enough to know, for example, that he doesn't buy the extraterrestrial invasion theory and that he thinks that the things people see are naturally occurring phenomena that most people just aren't aware of - but he never really sits down and explains it at length, despite the wealth of information he's gathered and thought about.However, the anecdotes and experiences presented were interesting - and by the sheer wealth and similarity of them, compelling. The nonlinear format might have helped to make it interesting in some ways, even if it distracted in others."
1913.1."SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!! Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead."
1914.2."Reads Like Keel's dropped his notes and never rearranged them Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it."
1915.3."Thought provoking, but.... Overall this was an entertaining and thought provoking book. Very little is mentioned about the mothman compared to UFOs, MIB, stange lights and cattle mutations. I did find Keels thoughts on vampires, angels and UFOs being all from the same entity very interesting. I kept finding myself wondering if Keel was overly paranoid, however this may well be the point. Are all people who encounter UFO's paranoid or are there powers at work that make them and us think they are paranoid? Now, I'm sounding paranoid! Because of this book, I will continue to read on UFO's , and for that reason I liked the book."
1916.1."Mothman proficies ? 257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman. If you want to read the same old 70's UFO stories, this is your book. If you want to read about the Mothman, buy something else."
1917.1."Boring & Unbelievable Story Normally, I prefer books to movies, but Mothman Prophecies was not only boring, but unbelievable. Non-fiction! The story was a product of the author's imagination. Perhaps in 1975, when the novel was first copywritten, it was spectacular. To those who are thinking of purchasing this book, (especially after viewing the movie) I'd say pass it up, and purchase the VHS or DVD."
1918.3."Slow start, but great ending sci-fi read This book, to me, starts out a little slow, in that the author focuses solely on THE mothman and peoples' accounts with him (what he looked like, did, etc.). For about the first 100 pages the author pretty much lists interviews and 1st hand accounts with contactees and their experiences. Though, after the 100th page or so (I don't know what it is about the 100th page for me), the book gets really interesting. Things start happening personally to John Keel himself. It seems as though, the more he begins to find out, and the deeper he goes into things, the more things begin to get in his way and stop him. It becomes apparent that someone or something doesn't want him to know what he knows.. Yet he persists. A very good book which lives up to its name."
1919.1."Never Before....... Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I've waited years to read this, oh man was I disappointed.I thought it would be an intelligent well written peice on the mothman mystery. I don't know what this was. Holy mackeral. i've never seen such bad writing. Someone else mentioned incoherent, tell me about it! This was all over the place. I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book. Just crazy!Just a few of my favourites:"" so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms. The child began to cry, more insulted than hurt."" what!? I'm thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted. This Keel dude is too much....Talking about this ""mysterious"" guy Tiny who a witness said saw a wire running up his pant leg. and i quote"" was tiny wearing electric socks? or was he a wired android operated by remote control.""what???! pretty much where I stopped before my mind turned to mush"
1920.1."huh? I just don't get it? I thought this book was a story about the paranormal and all the town needed to do was buy some Raid.Also anybody can tell you moths just son't grow that big... now June Bugs well now that's a story."
1921.2."BORING! The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving read. Unfortunately the presentation is disorganized, repetetive and BORING. I had to force myself to finish the thing and ended up wondering what the heck the point was meant to be. I certainly didn't feel that I had acquired any clear understanding of what happened in Point Pleasant; I didn't even get enough out of it to decide whether I believe any of the stories or not. If you want the book, borrow it from someone and save your money."
1922.2."A Let-Down... John Keel's ""Mothman Prophecies"" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the ""Mothman"" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled ""John Keel explains how the universe really works"". For every ""Mothman"" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the ""Mothman"" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's ""research"" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the ""Mothman"" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
1923.1."The Mothman in Bits and Pieces This book is NOT like the movie. In fact, I prefer the movie. The book is composed of bits and pieces of John Keel's and others' phenomenal experiences. It is difficult to read, not only because of the bad press printing, but also because it is very clipped and disjointed. I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!"
1924.3."the mothman prophecies I thought this book was very informative to the reader. It's the first book that I have read about 'mothman' or ufos and now I am more interested in the phenomena. The content of this book is good, but I think that it could have been organized a little better. It would have helped if the author told the story in chronological order. There is not much dialog, but if you enjoy reading a book filled with desccription, then this book would probably appeal to you. Do not expect the book to be just like the movie because it's not, it goes more into detail. The book was very interesting and gave John Keel's opinion about what happened in Point Pleasant."
1925.4."""It was a dark and stormy night"" John Keel's ""The Mothman Prophecies"" follows a usual form for ufology books: He presents a large collection of anecdotes, personal observations and experiences, mixes it with some debunking to woo the scientific mind, and throws in some ancient gods and goddesses, references to fairies, and a variety of religious ""sightings"". This is par for the course in this genre, and puts this reviewer in mind of Charlie Brown's standard beginning for tales, ""It was a dark and stormy night.""Despite its rather disorganized and somewhat repetitive presentation (again, fairly standard for this genre), Keel relates his narrative earnestly, and he will engage your interest. Men in Black? Saucer shaped vehicles with diamond-shaped windows? ""Thyroid-like eyes""? If this gets your attention, you'll enjoy ""The Mothman Prophecies.""The recent movie is based only loosely on Keel's research, by the way, and will fail to satisfy informed ufology readers."
1926.2."Interesting, but read the fine print.... Ok, we have seen the movie, some of us have read Keel's book (this being a reprint). What no one seems to mention is the fine print located on the copyright page, which reads: ""This is a work of fiction. All the characters and events portrayed in this book are either products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously."" If you don't believe me, glance at the copyright page. Obviously, this paperback edition was prepared as a movie tie-in. Touted as a ""true event"" the publisher then informs us it is all a work of the ""author's imagination."" And therein must lie a lot of truth. Yes, the book is mildly entertaining, if a bit choppy in parts. My advice is, read THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES with a large dose of salt (and the movie is much better)."
1927.4."SURREAL AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING I have never been interested in UFO literature, but decided to give this book a try. The early portions of the book are rather dry documentations of UFO sightings and other paranormal incidents. Towards the end of the book however, things pick up considerably. The author's description of events is credible and eerie. He concludes that so-called 'extraterrestrial' beings are really with us here on Earth but only perceived by those with perceptual abilities that most of us do not have. He also concludes that such beings are capable of influencing and interfering with humans. For books outside of the UFO literature that corroborate Mr. Keel's conclusions I recommend 1) The Active Side of Infinity (Carlos Castaneda), 2) Far Journeys (Robert Monroe), 3)The Path (Esmeralda Arana)."
1928.5."This book is a classic! I read it first in the 60's and have never forgotten it. I was pleased when it was reprinted as I had wanted to read it again. It holds up surprisingly well. Keel had realized things about the 'UFO phenomena' then that most other researchers are only now beginning to understand. If you have a sense of wonder, get it. If you are a researcher, get it. If you are an open minded skeptic, this will give you a better perspective. If you're just looking for entertainment, it's a lot of fun."
1929.5."Very comfortable Beautifully made and perfect for restorative yoga. I couldn't be happier. I own several other products from Hugger Mugger and always choose their product when available for bolsters, meditation cushions, etc."
1930.1."POOR QUALITY INCORRECT the item that is stated does not look like the stock graphics , the picture that is show is not what the item looks like . dont count on a good quality product"
1931.4."Great album, but one thing... I first heard M.I.A. in a recreation hall on my University's campus on a mixer with a great sound system (filled the entire downstairs and upstairs with sweet vibes). I agree with most of the points on other positive reviews: this has great beats, lyrics, vocals, and the likes.There is one thing you should keep in mind before buying or judging this album: it almost REQUIRES a good sound system because the music feeds off the bass. Like many ""dance"" genres, bass is a heavy component in making the tracks work, and this is no exception. The vocal are great, but have difficulty standing alone without heavy bass. Thus, if you're like me with two simple speakers and a default sound card, you might want to reconsider buying the album or risk slight disappointment.For me, it was a very upsetting difference, because I know what the songs COULD be. I would recommend high quality speakers/sound card and a woofer, or else you're missing out--big time."
1932.5."Buy it. She is a genius, has a lot to say, it's worth hearing, and this hard-to-categorize music absolutely grows on you and becomes your favorite album for weeks once it sinks in. Sound is fun, too, considering lots of toy instruments are used here, and there are a number of producers.M.I.A. is relevant, interesting and makes you pay attention.Buy this album."
1933.4."excellent For me this is a little tricky. I know next to nothing about this type of dance music, so I really have no criteria to judge MIA.But I do like the low frequencies, quite a shock for a rock and jazz guy. I also like the singer's voice: she can sing at quite a speed, but through her Shi Lankin accent, the emphasis is placed in the most interesting places. All the little moans and in between music noices remind me of jazz. I also like the little eletronic ambers that burn through the tracks.As sound, this is quite a treat."
1934.5."Worth the Buy You can't help but respect the creativity poring out of this album. This was M.I.A.'s debut & the reason why so many love her. I love this album & it hasn't left the car in weeks."
1935.1."Why Can't I Rate at Zero Stars ? Come On, People !!!! I checked this out because Amazon emailed me saying it was top rated.... ??? Could it be because one of the ""songs"" is entitled ""Amazon"" ? Sex appeal !? Not !!!! - unless you want to have sex with a monkey.... And for those who think this is the best album they've heard in a long time - my condolences ! Seriously, this recording is nothing more than a possibly somewhat cute girl chanting gibberish over some low-fi computer generated noise loops. True artists should be outraged, and they would if they could stop laughing. I recommend steering way way clear of this sorry excuse for music. Please, people - don't let big music money tell you what is good - we all suffer for it in the end."
1936.2."Sound Catchy but mix with Terrorists I have to agree some songs sound very catchy.But isn't she singing about some Terrorist Group in some Asian Island? I heard even MTV ban some of her songs because of that."
1937.2."surprised she's sri lankan but it's like she's trying to be west indian or something. Ok it kind of works and she's really pretty but I think she would become even bigger if she marketed herself to bollywood and gave the music the dancehall sound. It would give her some nice exposure."
1938.2."OK You can tell the difference between this and the next. A couple of good songs, nothing spectacular. One song on this CD appears on the movie ""War"" with Jet-Li. Although I rate this with an OK, Im very tough. There's no sappy love ballads, no whiney boy songs. It's in your face, and strong."
1939.3."huh? yeah, gotta concur with the rest of the folks reviewing this album here, what the hell was all that hype for? any one of my faded friends with fruity loops or even reason could have made these beats, first off. secondly, does this chick's vocal style make anyone but me think of the spice girls? if you're looking for something new, genre-bending, and actually interesting beyond any dancehall vibe it might instill, check out the new prefuse 73 album. i'm just glad i downloaded arular instead of buying it. suckers."
1940.1."A Question Can someone please tell me how she managed to be signed by A!!!!record label, let alone one capable of putting her music (if that's what you call it) into the airwaves as much as it is."
1941.1."fine if you support terrorism I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-""Growin up, Brewin UpGuerilla gettin trained uplook out look outFrom over the Rooftop"" [reffering to LTTE snipers]""Competition coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop""She has a lot of LTTE propaganda in her music website, and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music. She needs to get a grip, and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they're buying here."
1942.4."At least she's hotter than hell ;) Galang is the strongest track here and I'd agree with many that it is no musical revolution. I enjoy it due to the fact it's a WORLD disc and I like World music alot. It's definitely different and I had seen the video for GALANG on the IMF Satellite channel. She's hotter than hell in my opinion so I'll give her a break. ;)And with those criticizing Revolution, America was created on a violent Revolution so I have no idea what they're talking about. When you live under brutal oppression you revolt which none of us in America understand anymore. Thank God we don't have to revolt here like others but people need to study what goes on in certain areas of the globe.Sometimes simple beats are good and this is better than alot of the major Rap trash here without any meaning at all."
1943.4."She's A Paradigm in the Making. If you don't believe in her politics, listen to the music - we can't all be John Lennon. But we could aspire to be Public Enemy - different genre, same ethos. With her minimalist approach, she jettisons a rapid-fire selection of rage, humour, politics [sometimes muddled and confusing], sex...but always arresting and thought provoking. Online pugilists argue the terrorist/Tamil revolutionary ties via her father, and while it's an important salient subject to spelunk, weaving the politico with the dance floor is an exhilarating art I can't overlook based on that writ - Madonna could learn a thing or two about juxtaposing them creatively [see American Life]. My grade: A"
1944.2."Gets old fast The first time through I really enjoyed the quick quirky beats, and the skits were sorta interesting as well. The novelty wore off after the first play through and it soon went from quick, quirky, and interesting to obnoxious, and boring. Perhaps this just isn't my style of music but I heard a lot of good things about this album and figured I'd give it a try. I found myself enjoying her biography a lot more than her album."
1945.3."Aquired taste I didn't like this album that much at first, but it grew on me. I got this CD as a gift, listened to it once and threw it a side. I decided to give it a second chance and it really grew on me as I listened to it more and more. The singing at times gets on my nerves, but I like a lot of the songs. The lyrics are the best part of this album. ""Fire Fire"" and ""Amazon"" are my to favorite songs. Some of the electronica is interesting, and she does not sound like anyone."
1946.5."Awesomely Different This is something my ears crave; uniqueness. This album has what you need to get loose. With it's wild beats and crazy lyrics, it'll keep you dancing (and in my case, running as well. Good workout music). M.I.A.'s music is not conventional. My guess is, most people either love it or hate it. Enjoy, it's a treat!1. Banana Skit2. Pull Up The People 8/103. Bucky Done Gun 10/10 (My fav. A true dance track. On point)4. Fire Fire 9/105.

1947.3."A mixed bag....... well... i bought this cd, soley for the reason that i loved the song 'Galang'. After listening to it through a couple times- i started to notice some lyrics that had a somewhat disturbing ouvre. This is evident in 'Fire Fire', and ""Sunshowers""...Other than that...this album doesnt live up to what i thought it would... some good beats, though."
1948.3."M.I.A. - 'Arular' (Beggar's Banquet) Not all that familiar with this artist.Seems like decent dance,house,club...whatever some call this genre these days.The remix of ""Amazon"",""Fire Fire"" and the seven-minute ""Galang"",I thought was good.No,this isn't even close to my favorite sort of music,but I thought I'd give it a listen.If you're the type of person that hangs out in dance clubs until 2am,you should dig 'Arular'.Might appeal to fans of Beyonce,Ciara and Missy Elliott."
1949.2."What's the big deal? The only thing interesting about this album is mia's accent. Seriously, the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clichéd. If the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top 500. Final Verdict: Bad music."
1950.1."#2 overall on editor's top 100 albums??? Wow, what kind of credentials do you need to be a amazon critic or editor? Certainly not good taste in music! The selection of this album at #2 on the editor's picks of the top 100 of 2005 leaves me grasping for reality and laughing til I can't breathe. You've got to be musically challenged, deaf, and under 12 to like one track on this album. The 5 star ratings?a sure sign the apocalypse is upon us."
1951.5."Take this simple test If you can listen to this album - any track on this album - for more than 4 or at most 5 seconds and (1) stay still (2) keep it clean and PG13, my condolences to your family, alas, you are dead. You can expect to be receiving the memo shortly."
1952.5."Love It! Who is M.I.A. and what has she done to the art of music?! The London-raised Sri Lankan MC has mixed up all possible forms of music to give us something that we can't define. You can't put a label on her sound; you can only identify her inspiration. With a combination of Jamaican dance hall, hip-hop, electronica, Brazilian funk, and Asian bhangra, her style is different from anything we're used to; it's addictive and fun. Her lyrics are filled with passion about life and society. She gets political and sexual all in the same song! Who does that? Maya Arulpragasam does... just listen to Bucky Done Gun off her debut album Arular to get a feel of her artistic flair."
1953.5."Wha can I get for ten dollah? Anyting you want! Definitely spend a couple of bucks more & get this. Maya Arular is one of the few hip-hop sensations who deserves all the hype. Phrases like ""raw talent"" are often used, but what also impress are the musical sophistication and biting wit. This is a hugely appealing sex-war-and-lollipops album, and fears that non-British audiences ""won't get it"" seem to have been unfounded judging by the sales. Exuberant and bursting with energy."
1954.4."Can't get enough! Gosh where to begin. First off, thank the powers that be for artists like M.I.A.!Sitars, bongo drums, thumping basslines, blips and beats, there is everything but the kitchen sink in Arular. M.I.A.'s music is in a genre all of its own. More a fusion of hip-hop and electronica with a healthy dose of South Asian flavoring. I can't even begin to tell you how welcome and refreshing her sound is in this era of cardboard, cookie cutter music.Stand out tracks include Galang, Hombre, Pull Up The People and Sunshowers. While M.I.A. brings together a wild range of sounds and beats, it's fairly accessible and this is music you will want to dance to. Highly recommended."
1955.4."rhythmic, textured, danceable electronic music i love this music, but i can see how some people wouldn't. i guess reading through the reviews here says the same thing: this doesn't try to be the kind of music my mother would like (or some of my coworkers). but that must be obvious if you listen to the samples amazon provide.but otherwise, this is pretty sweet - it strikes a nice balance between playing with new ideas/sounds on the one hand and keeping a steady groove on the other. ""commerical experimental"" in a good way - and i think that's a very challenging target.as for the politics and trying to second guess whether this woman is ""for real"" - it doesn't matter unless you don't like the music. good music doesn't need to (and usually doesn't) match my politics. why on earth should it? if you don't like the music, fair enough. but to argue that you don't like music because of the attitude or the politics - what's with that? you're confusing music with something else, i think."
1956.5."this girl can spit! i first heard the track bingo on the radio not long ago, and that has now opened a whole can of worms for me. how can one album be so catchy, raw, fun,fresh ,chunky and funky. while so many rappers drawl on about tired blah blah, MIA just mixes the singing and ragga-ish vocals straight into the most modern type of no-category music with little effort. the style? its kind of UK grime meets hip-hop meets calypso or something. definately a british vibe here, but this is still unique. the beats and sound effects are very well implemented into the chatting. cant stop listening to this. wicked stuff"
1957.2."M.I.A. This sounds like karaoke. I wish it didn't - but it does. I'm a white man married to an Indian girl - I love Indian music, Chutney is cool, reggae, etc. - and the lead singer is attractive - but it really, really sounds like karaoke....I can't escape that fact. And...yes....it is very repetitive, mundane, same sounding music throughout the whole CD. But, it doesn't matter because todays ear for music is pretty much on the deaf side. Simple and repetitive is the cornerstone of todays musical taste. Oh well - I'll watch the video though - she's cute. But, it is still a talentless serving up of supposed 'world music'. What a bunch of crap that is! Listen to 'The Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria' or 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' if you want REAL world music. What? It's boring? Then you don't really like 'World Music' - lol."
1958.1."Anyone notice terrorist references? This is good music, but I really have a problem with some of the lyrics.For instance, Sunshowers:""You wanna win a war? Like PLO I don't surrender""""It's a bomb yo, so run yo, put away your stupid gun yo... that's why we blow it up before we go""""they showed him a picture then, ain't that you with the muslims?""Now I'm not one for censorship, but I can't back someone glorifying PLO and terrorism in dance music. That's just ridiculous. I know reggae has roots of being somewhat violent and rebellious back at its early roots, but I absolutely can't sponsor these messages. It's just wrong."
1959.3."Clear your head before committing to this! In this critical examination of the ""art of the novel"", Kundera meditates upon the existence or non-existence of ""art"" in novel-writing. It is a combination of narrative and philosophical ponderings highlighted by Kundera's famed lyricism. However, therein lies the the book's weakness. The dense language could lose your ""average"" reader and some issues, such as the meaning of art, begin to lean far more towards the philosophical rather than in analytical technique. Kundera tends to wander off on tangents."
1960.5."His Best? Well it so hard to pick a favorite Kundrea book because they are all so Brilliant, but I might pick this one."
1961.5."The Three Ds I've read the poems within, and the depth of feeling within them is impressive. What's more, the honesty in the poems is a breath of fresh air that has brought a new perspective to a lot of the ways I see things, partcularly loss and betrayal, as well as hope. Reading this book, I feel as if I truly know the poet behind the words."
1962.3."mixed reviews I have had a set of 8 blue colorwave for at least three years now. I love the square salad plates and the bowls have held up great. The plates seem to be the problem. Some of the plates are not molded the same and will not stack nicely. Utensil scratches are the biggest problem. Originally one or two plates were very bad that we only used them when we had to. Now they are all developing scratches. I will be looking for a new set of dishes soon. Maybe I should avoid stonewear."
1963.4."How to beat the gray marks I like the simple design of Noritake Colorwave dishes, but was unhappy with gray marks from metal tableware. I have discovered that the right dishwasher detergent takes care of this. I was using a phosphate-free powder, for ecological reasons, but it was not getting my dishes clean. Researching this, I learned that in the last year, phosphate-free dishwasher detergents have improved a lot, so this problem may go away by itself. Otherwise, try a different phosphate-free detergent; the tablets seem to work best."
1964.2."Noritake Colorwave 16 piece place setting I ordered a 16 piece place setting , service for 4 but only recieved a 4 piece place setting, service for 1. I contacted Amazon and they arranged to have the order corrected and arrange for return for the incorrect order. Once to corrected shipment arrived again it was a service for only 1. I was charged for a service for 4. This was eventually credited back to me however since I only had 2 place settings, I purchased 2 others locally at Younker's department store. The dishes that came with from Amazon are different than the ones from Younker's. It is like the molds were different or something...the plates are deeper from Amazon and as a result the set does not stack properly. I am not certain if this inventory issue has been resolved with Amazon so buyer beware."
1965.4."After ten years . . . For our wedding registry, we chose this Colorwave set. That was more than ten years ago. I liked it because the color (we have green) was attractive, and it wasn't too fancy for everyday use. The set has held up fine, with the exception that two out of twelve bowls have nicked. The bowls nick more easily than the plates and coffee mugs, which haven't nicked at all. Considering it's been ten years, I don't think the nicking problem is all that bad. I just have to be extra careful with the bowls. They tend to nick when I'm washing the dishes and accidentally bang them against one another."
1966.4."Very good product. Noritake product are really durable and I was worried since the first set was purchase in 2005, what will be the color if I get some more plates in 2011? There is in fact a little color change but nothing disturbing. Probably due to the use of a dishwasher for many years! The new plates are a bit more brilliant and a little touch darker...Really happy about this purchase..."
1967.4."Timeless classic. I just finished Gods Of Mars and am ready for chapter 3. I feel truly fortunate to have ""discovered"" burroughs at 43. The rush of action, the clash of steel and its all mine for the taking. I have been forewarned that perhaps after the first three books it becomes hit and miss but I shall discover that for myself. Do yourself a favor and pick up A Princess Of Mars - book 1 - if you haven't already."
1968.1."Great story sorriest printing and binding Ive ever witnessed The story , of course , is fabulous but this is the worst binding I have ever seen in 30+ years of reading paperbacks. I can't believe this isnt a joke. Hopefully I can get a refund and order the book from a reputable publisher later. If you buy a paperback from anyone make dang sure it isnt an ""Instabook"""
1969.4."Album worth a Review Lets get to the point. If I were to listen the album, without any knowledge of Derrick Plourde, or the lyrical content I would of seriously overlooked the album. The music (compared to older) is so bland. The riffs are weak, the guitar work is recycled, the drums are painfully dull. The music really has no edge.But throw in the sensative underlying message in the equation(suicide), and it truly livens up the record. TRULY. The album is 3rd right after DUH and TRASHED.NOTE: Drumming did go out the window after Plourde left! The man was sick. Bad astro showed none of his talent.Pick this record up."
1970.3."CONSISTANTLY GREAT!! Lagwagon always delivers. Their records are always full of great riffs, hooks, melodies. This one is no different. It will take me a few days to digest these 12 songs, but it's very good (as ususal). Lots of references to former drummer Derrick Plourde who commited suicide earlier this year. Has the same style, fast, upbeat, some metal-like solos....Great stuff, buy it."
1971.5."A wish to time travel to 1880's Rockaway. Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's."
1972.4."Great to see the old neighborhood! I would probably have given this book 5 stars if the Belle Harbor section (where I grew up in the 60's and 70's) had been better represented, but still, it was great to see the neighborhood I left as a teenager in 1976!For those that live --or lived-- there, especially if you spent any amount of time in Far Rock, you must get this book.To the authors: issue a revised edition with a more emphasis on everything West of Beach 116th Street... and I'll go 5 and a half stars in my next review!"
1973.4."Old Rockaway, New York, in Early Photographs. Simply the only printed information available about the Rockaways of yesterday. It seems that everyone has roots in this once grand seaside community and this book gives you hundred of old postcard views of the towns along the beach. There's not much left there from the old days and even fewer people left in the NYC slum who know how to read or right. So we'll bet that most of the sales of this book will be outside of Rockaway. But if you're heart's at the seashore, then Vincent and William's book should be in your library...EKG, (escaped to Long Beach, NY)"
1974.5."Lyricist, singer, and more!!!!!!! Bernie is one of the best lyricists out there!!! His vocal performance on this cd and ""Tribe"" show that he is not just a lyric writer, but also someone who loves music. His passion for music has continued on to the formation of the band ""Farmdogs"".I have a question, however. The previous reviews state that this is either Bernie's second or third solo album. What were his first attempts?Please let me know at: Robin@moonsitter.comThank you!!!!"
1975.2."2/5 This album is 2 stars because some of the songs are listenable. I hardly enjoy listening to this album.I hardly recommend this album. Addy."
1976.2."FORMULATIC AND HEARTLESS THis band from Scandinavia reminds me of Stratovarius. They sound so clean, so perfect, that you almost forget they are playing rock. It's boring and flat sound, and the female singer is annoying with his boring voice. It's a totally forgetable experience."
1977.5."One great album! I bought this album because I got into bands like Theatre of Tragedy, Tristania, and The Gathering. Like someone else said, however, Nightwish is not doom/goth metal. Was I dissapointed?...no! This album is a masterpiece, pure metal all the way. Power metal with a female opera singer? I can't think of two things which go together any better. It is a wonder that it hasn't been done before. The songwriting is very good, and definitely laden with fantasy. The production is excellent as well. Then there is the amazing singer. I was captivated after hearing her for a mere ten seconds. Nightwish is one band that SHOULD NOT be overlooked!"
1978.3."Great music, horrible mastering Wishmaster is one of my favorite Nightwish albums. However, I was always disappointed with the insanely high dynamic range compression and distortion on the CDs. So I thought why not try the LP instead - with any luck it'll have a completely different master. Unfortunately, it seems like all they did was apply the RIAA curve to the CD and cut it into vinyl.If you're buying this for the collector's value then great, but if you actually want to listen to it don't bother and just stick with the CD instead."
1979.5."The Greatest Band To Ever grace my ears Nightwish Rules! The Music is spine tingling and melodic while powerful. Everything I thought I knew About Music has changed forever. As a long Time fan of Savatage, and other prog-metal bands.. Nightwish has become my favorite. I can play their music over and over... I never thought I would enjoy Opera but her voice seems to be meant for it...like we never should have had to listen to it any other way. The world is full of tasteless crap like eminem, and god please can we forget the boybands and all the other put together mindless gatbage we are smacked with by local radio. NIGHTWISH Thank you for the wonderful barrage of sound you have given to me. I still love my other-prog metal bands but Nightwish has something for everyone who enjoys ""TRUE"" Music. Death to the false ones! LOL"
1980.5."The perfect formula still to be copied Nightwish works so near perfection! None of the other similar bands (Lacuna Coil, Sinergy, Stratovarius, Angra...) even approach this. No, Therion approaches. Many people tend to compare Nightwish to doom/goth metal bands such as Theatre Of Tragedy, Tristania and Sins Of Thy Beloved. Please, Nightwish is not doom/goth metal, it's clearly high level POWER METAL! Fast versatile guitar riffs, poignant ballads and above all, intense female vocals. Wishmaster's most touching moment is the gentle ""Two For Tragedy"", when Tarja's passionate lament reaches the soul of the listener. Other highlights are the fast ""Wanderlust"" and ""Crownless"". The last song, ""FantasMic"", is divided in three parts and is also very touching. Wishmaster and its predecessor Oceanborn are without a doubt essential albums for any metal listener..."
1981.3."Predictable,Boring, Stratovarius clown Well...I heard so much about this CD, and i decided to give it a listen. As a power-metal guitarist, i can tell you that the only thing that stands out about this band, is Tarja's vocals. Music sounds like a predictable Yngwie or/and Stratovarius tune. After all, it's not a bad album, even though it'll become a shelf-material after a few spins. But if you are really looking for some good power metal, listen to Sinergy,Stratovarius,Rhapsody or even Armaggedon."
1982.1."L T Very disappointed with this one .Try their CDs Dark Passion Play and Once .They get five stars from me ."
1983.2."interesting, but... it's an interesting idea to have a operatic female vox in a metal band; however, her voice is mediocre (you'd know it's true if you know some names from the opera genre), and the music is not original at all. Does anyone know any similar bands (with operatic female vox) that are better than this? Let me know. Thanks!"
1984.5."Nightwish is unique and rocks for eva Moi to you all,Nightwish est vraiment le plus cool des bands. Unqiue pis des tounes supers orginales, ca ma faite découvrir le métal pis aucune autre band ma faite vribrer comme eux. À tous le monde cest un must buy."
1985.5."Why just 4 stars? Un album tout simplement renversant, extraordinaire, sensationnelle. Il est excellent sur toute la ligne avec une voix si bien cadré, si bien mis en evidence devenant la suite de se qu'ils avaient commencer avec Oceanborn, il revienne a la charge avec une disque presque aussi parfait. Un album tout comme le deuxieme, remplis de rebondissement, remplis de moment intense et de moment plus romantique avec Dead Boy's Poem qui est sans aucun doute la meilleur toute qu'ils ont faites. Souvent comparer a Dream Theater pour leur beat de piano, d'instrument progressif, ils ont sus selon moi allez une coche au dessus et nous offrir quelque chose d'encore superieur au membre de Dream Theater... En bref, il s'agit d'un CD dispendieux, mais combien il en vaut la peine, il est merveilleux et chaqu'un se doit de connaitre se magnifique groupe Allemand."
1986.4."Just like the hospital and doc's clinic I bought 3 other types of thermometers -temporal scan, auxuliary thermometer (but), oral thermometer, but was getting tired of guessing her temperature. I just decided to purchase this one, the same one used by my hospital and personal doc. So happy to have peace of mind."
1987.5."Welch Allen Suretemp Plus 690 Thermometer Finally got fed up with all small digital thermometers, none of which seem to be reliable, or require a full 3-4 minutes to be accurate, which is an aggravating long time for the (OB) patient. I LOVE this ""machine"", it is accurate and well worth the expense !"
1988.3."Good device but yearly probe replacement required As a physician who has used many electronic thermometers, this one is about the best and fastest. It stands up to abuse well as my nurse has dropped it numerous times and it still functions fine. My only complaint(and the reason why I gave 3 stars not 5) is that the probe needs to be replaced regularly. I spoke with an individual in customer support who stated the average probe lasts approximately one year, then needs to be replaced(an error message comes up, rendering the unit unusable). The probe replacement is ~$85. I think that if you spend this amount of money on a thermometer, you should get more than a years use out of it before having to replace expensive parts."
1989.3."Welch Allyn Suretemp Plus 690 Electronic Thermometer The thermometer is really good once you get it working. I was not very happy that I bought it ""Brand New"" and when I tried to use it, didn't work. I had to ship the Thermometer Probe back, then waited for a week, then tried again and still wasn't working, so I ended having to ship back the Thermometer with all accesories. It took a few weeks to get it back and working.Welch Allyn however, were very good at keeping the guaranty and sending back to me the thermometer after it was fixed."
1990.5."Great thermometer, long-lasting We do home care for my dad and have to take his rectal temperature every 2 hours when we turn and re-position him. We have had the same Welch-Allyn Sure Temp 690 thermometer for 4 1/2 years now. We just replaced the well and probe a few months ago. The casing finally cracked after all of this time. We have only had to change the batteries twice, too. It is still working perfectly and we would recommend this thermometer to anyone who really needs to take temperatures often. It is so reliable. This one gets 5 stars!!!!!"
1991.3."For aficionados only If you've not read any Lawrence this is not the book to start with. It fails as a novel because there is no story to speak of, just a string of scenes to initiate discussion of the issues Lawrence wished to explore. Apologists describe it as picaresque, but there is far more unity to most novels that deserve that descriptor. Nonetheless, there are wonderful scenes that fitfully jar this book to life, Lawrence's admirable command of language, and a brooding homoeroticism aching to burst out. Try this book after you've hit the major works (i.e. Women in Love, etc.)."
1992.4."once put together..it's great!! This tent takes a little work to put together. I don't know what people are talking about when they refer to the wooden poles and getting splinters as the poles on mine are metal. Anyway, once put together it is quite cool! I am 5ft 9"" and I managed to be able to sit in it along with my 4 year old (sitting) and my 5month old baby (lay down) so there is plenty of space. I got mine on sale at a babies r us store, so I don't think I would actually pay (...)for it though. You could by a basic regular tent for that much!"
1993.1."Broke in less then a month I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. I went to bed one night and it was up, but the next morning it was halfway down. When I went to see what was wrong I saw that one of the rods had snapped off in the metal holder and cannot be fixed. This could actually suffocate a baby if noone was in the room or the baby could hurt themselves if they found the broken rod. I was very disappointed because the size is great. I also agree with the other reviews it is hard to put together because the rods are so tight you have to have alot of strenth to get it set up. Please don't buy this we are going to return but it's such a hassle to spend 39.99 plus tax on something and it breaks in less then a month."
1994.2."BORING... The information was worthwhile, but I found this video to be blah and boring. If you are going to bother to make a documentary at least make it somewhat entertaining! Add some interesting visuals and use a narrator that catches your attention. Read a book on this subject and by-pass this DVD."
1995.5."A Great Documentary this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. and also tells how alice in wonderland was created. this was a very intersting documentary. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
1996.2."This may be a shortened version of ""Howlin' Wolf Live Gold"" This CD looks to be a 9 track version of the Howlin' Wolf Live Gold CD (Fine Tune 2212-2) which has 14 tracks and appears to be available through Amazon Marketplace (the first nine tracks are in identical order on both CD's). From listening to the samples on Amazon the sound quality of the 9 track CD appears to be the same since as the Fine Tune version. The Fine Tune audio quality is not all that good, may not really be live, but it is the Wolf, after all. Thought fair warning was in order."
1997.5."Beethoven, Motzart, Sanford Townsend Band ........ Thats how music history books should be written, it was 1977, I first heard this album on a verandah overlooking the Indian Ocean in Perth Western Australia on a hot breezy Saturday evening watching the sun setting over the whitetops ..... WOW, what a old flashback that is, party goin on inside, my Triumph under the balcony, I got up, grabbed the keys, and went for a blast, that song has been a permanant source of pleasure in my old head for decades now .... mist in your eyes from the smoke of a distant fire.... da da da da ada, sounds even better with the exhaust note of a 750 Bonnie ... da da da da"
1998.3."Looks Like I Backed Into a Square Deal I originally saw this band in Hollywood at The Roxy in 1977. They were virtual unknowns at the time, opening for Dion - of all artists! I owned the 12"" LP, but lost it somewhere in a move. I have been anxiously waiting for the release of this CD.Although Smoke From A Distant Fire is their best known hit (peaked at #9 in 1977), there are other strong tracks on this CD. Among them, ""In For The Night"" demonstrates the vocal range and songwriting abilities of both Ed Sanford and John Townsend.The lyrics are especially compelling. Most of the songs tell stories (a la Gordon Bok). Whether they be of love lost, love found or one of my favorites -- ""Lawdy Lou"", a story of a friend who loses another to an overdose -- they are presented along with compelling arrangements.This is late 70s pop-jazz, Steely Dan-inspired music at its best. Good lyrics, instrumentation. This is a ""musicians band"" if ever there was one."
1999.5."The Witches' God by Janet and Stewart Farrar This is a really good book for people that are studying the gods. I truely enjoyed this book. It was very informative."
2000.5."The best book on Pagan Gods All too often the Pagan God is forgotten in favor of the Goddess. This book will bring the balance back to our lives. It gives the history of many well know Gods as well as many not so well known Ones. It also includes rituals in direct relation to the Gods listed. I love this book! It goes well with The Witches' Goddess!"
2001.4."Best PUR CD, but not just the music is important This is definetely the best PUR CD ever, but I've to add that the lyrics of this band are very important and if you don't understand them, you'd like it much less. I don't say anything against the music with that, but the words have at least the same importance."
2002.5."Beautiful Submission What struck me the most all throughout the reading of ""Beauty and submission"" is the power and bravery behind Maria Pita's prose. She is undoubtedly a wise old soul. Yet, in the same instance, her no-holds-barred honesty about the lifestyle and personal odyssey with her beloved Dom has a youthful innocence that refreshes and renews like rain in the springtime. Love is new, and forever renewed, by each other. Life obstacles faced by most vanilla lovers face are present along with the countless obstacles any alternative lifestyle will bring. Every such mountain is a challenge scaled with intelligent and triumphant results. Missa's enormous heart, and huge capacity to love and submit to her man in the purest sense, will stay with me (and I'm sure all her readers) long after this book is closed. This real life romance makes fictional renditions pale in comparison."
2003.1."Where was the editor? Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues)."
2004.2."Like a train wreck, you want to look away, but you can't. I picked up Beauty & Submission on a whim, after reading the back cover. I have recently begun to read a few BDSM and thought this book would help broaden my knowledge of the submissive aspect. I was disappointed with the outcome.I thought the book held more issues with jealousy and swinging than the day-to-day life of a lifestyle submissive. I also thought that the slave seemed to switch between a dominant/submissive role. There were quite a few references to watersports which were personally not my cup o' tea, as you might say.I did not enjoy all the pages where she ""quoted"" from her other novels. I believe the book would have been half the size if these would have been cut from the copy. It felt like an attempt to sell her other books."
2005.3."Disregard the earlier reviews of this album. The information provided by both the professional and customer reviewers for this album does not pertain to this specific title. Although I recommend Distant Light instead of this title, this one features the vocals of Allan Clarke in a similar vein and context to two albums that appeared a few years earlier: the aforementioned Distant Light and Romany.Clarke's vocal work here is admirable; the group itself appears to have shed its Top Pop radio persona (although The Air That I Breathe did do well on the charts), and offer a more mature and thoughtful collection of tunes."
2006.3."Need More Information This listing does not indicate the bonus tracks that are included. So, I don't know which version of the album this is.The one to get, of course, is the latest version which includes the previously unreleased bonus tract ""Burn Fire Burn.""I wish I knew if this CD has that song."
2007.4."Arizona Diamondbacks 59Fifty Hat The product came in about 3 days after ordering. The hat fits well and 59Fifty finally put in a black hat liner in the inside of the hat, which I like. I wish the ""A"" logo was bigger."
2008.1."Beware of packaging Sorry I know this is supposed to be a review of the item, but I want my complaint heard by anyone that might buy it. The hat itself is great, if you buy it at the store. New Era hats have large bills and a tall crown, but as long as you don't have a tiny head it will look fine. My complaint was that they shipped me this hat in a dvd box. Seriously. The hat was completely flattened, leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo. Ruined hat if you ask me, and will be returning immediately. You're probably better off buy this item in a hat store and spend the extra few dollars, at least they will have treated it right up to that point."
2009.1."Tiene que ser sensilla!! Quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama, talento, y bellesa que esta mujer tiene? No tiene voz suave, ni fuerte. Deveria dedicarse a otra cosa. Lo que sea.. menos cantar, y actuar porque seria igual de ridicula que Patty Navidad!! Este es uno de los peores Discos que he escuchado en toda mi vida!!"
2010.1."Ha Ha Ha Why is she not famous? I agree with the other smart reviewer, because she STINKS! Wow does she stink! I had no choice but to throw her CD in the trash. I wasn't going to torture anyone by giving them this CD as a present! No way! I just THREW IT AWAY!"
2011.2."I couldn't get into it I just coulAfter getting more than 50% through the book, I had to stop ... I just couldn't get into it and didn't like the writting style."
2012.3."Ok read I'm a history lover but will read novels and memoirs. There were points in the book were the author lost me. However not much said about the mother. Title is not good for this book."
2013.2."Not complimentary. This book really disappointed me. It seems like a narrative. No real plot just a rambling repetitive narration of a poor island child. I wish I could say I loved it....but felt really let down."
2014.3."difficult When first buying this book I throught it was gonna be about the author's mother. The book is about this girl name Xuela, who's mother died giving birth to her. Xuela father gave her to the woman who washed his clothes, and only visted every now and then. Xuela eventually moved back in with him and his new family only to move again with another family. I throught Xuela was one of the strangest characthers i've ever read about. Her views on things were so strange. The other thing i didn't like about this book, it had no dialouge, which mean a lot of long paragraphs."
2015.1."Repetitive and monotone I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly."
2016.1."Disappointing I had hoped to read a colorful story about life in the Caribbean, and was not expecting the story to be happy and uplifting. However, I was disappointed to discover that the most prevalent topics in the book were the character's bodily smells, excretions, and sex life. I was left wondering what these aspects of the book had to do with the character's mother."
2017.2."A fast, but mostly unpleasant read This is the story of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seek out any joy in her life. The overall feeling of the story is negative and depressing."
2018.1."Worst book I've ever read This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I ""attempted"" to read by the author, since I couldn't waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade."
2019.1."Puzzling After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' ""The Stranger"", I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found ""Autobiography of my Mother"" completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in ""The Stranger"", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white ""conquerers"" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"
2020.4."Sad story - hopeless afterlife Losing a mom - never knowing your mom - living your life in anger. Sad. No redemption. It made me sad that some people stay in that state and do not find the only answer which is Jesus Christ. But I know this is true for many who's hearts remain hard who have a big God void in their lives. It was an interesting story....but very hopeless and sad."
2021.3."The Autobiography of My Mother I thought it very wordy and drawn out and very slow reading. I would have liked a little more ooph in it."
2022.2."The autobiography of my mother Did not really get lost in there book....found it boring....and I really wanted to stop reading it! But chose to painstakingly finish it.."
2023.1."The autobiography of my mother It's not a book I'll ever read again. It was very boring. Glad I didn't pay that much. I give it a star."
2024.2."repetitive This book has flowery language and the story line seems to have potential but the book never goes any where. I skimmed much of it, hoping it would develop plot and character, but it really never did. The plot and language were repetitive and didn't hold my attention. It seemed as though the author had a point she was trying hard to get to but it just never happened."
2025.1."Pseudo-nihilistic garbage. A waste of paper and ink. What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work"
2026.1."Do I have to give it a star? Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the ""wetness between [her] legs"", or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."
2027.1."Don't buy this book Jean Giorno assigned rights to this story to the public domain. Unscrupulous, evil American publishers are acting contrary to the author's intent and prostituting this work by cracking down on English language versions (including online versions), even new translations from the French. Don't give your money to greed heads who are 180 degrees in conflict with the principles of this book."
2028.2."disappointing, confusing, not an good intro to snmp This was not a good first book to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. As an example, the definition of a subtype I found in another text (a subset of the value set for a type) was quite clear, then I checked the Simple definition of subtype and found its was useful to ""refine the semantics"" of a ""data object"" and that ""it may be useful to create a new data type for strings using other repertoires, such as ASCII"". The author also notes that the ""ASN.1 rules for subtyping are long and complex"". (p 34-35). Hello? This book may be useful as a reference after reading other, better written introductions, but avoid it if you are new to SNMP. Also, I recommend that the novice learn ASN.1 first, rather than alsong with SNMP in a combined text. Also, SNMPv2 has yet to catch on, the Simple book focuses primarily on this version, not of much interest if you are working with version 1."
2029.1."Reading an RFC is more fun and more informative too! The editor and publisher of this book should be ashamed. It is an extended rant by the author that has no business being bound in hard cover. The Pine Mountain Group recommends excerps from this book to get up to speed with SNMP. I wonder who at PMG is friends with the author. This book will teach only members of the ""network management community"" anything. Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic. The shame of it is that this author could educate profoundly if a good editor enforced some discipline or a co-author came in to help with communicating with those who are not the author's peers."
2030.1."Not just disappointed, angered. It's hard to believe that this book was released by a major publisher. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical errors. The thin index is almost useless, as a close examination reveals it to be mostly a list of the author's friends and their nicknames."
2031.2."Horrible for beginners; no comment as a reference I am a developer with 8 years experience but novice to Network programming. A friend suggested this book as a first and default one to start with. I am completely disappointed. It's not a practical, jump-into it, internet-age book. Let me see if it serves any purpose as a reference. BTW, the CD is totally useless. It has only a few files which you can anyway download for free."
2032.2."Disappointing that Amazon's Price is 15.00 more than at B&N Book has some interesting insight but does little to develop technical understanding. Is cheaper at B&N locally"
2033.4."A warm farewell to our stranded friends on Tran-ky-ky. Prolific SF writer Alan Dean Foster wraps up the adventures of the stranded Ethan Fortune and Suka September on the ice planet of Tran-ky-ky in a nice little package for fans of the series. Turns out the thawing of the ice at the equator Ethan saw in the second book (Mission to Moulkin) was not natural at all, someone is actually attempting to thaw out the planet. That could mean possible extinction for the Tran, which is unexceptable to Fortune and September. They and their Tran friends head out on the Slanderscree to see that the process is stopped, permanently. A wonderful ending to a wonderful series, highly recommended."
2034.5."St. Rose of Lima: the First Canonized Saint in the Americas Excellent read, for children or for any age; also for adults who want to get to know Saint Rose of Lima."
2035.4."New Toe jaming sounds Shows a sense of creativity with sound effects that reveals the artist's ability to be in touch with todays concerns. Loved the Twist!"
2036.2."poetic but excessive I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than novels."
2037.5."Wonderful app I love reading Essence magazine, I am happy I can now read it on my kindle fire. I recommend this"
2038.2."Wolf in Sheep's Clothing!!!!! I'm thinking of cancelling my subscription. Ever since Time Warner Publishing acquired Essence, it seems to be cantering to dark-skinned white women and NOT Black women."
2039.5.Delivered As Promised I LOVE Essence and I am quite pleased with the delivery and maintence by Amazon, I receive it like clockwork each month!
2040.4."Essence I love the magazine, but I would love to receive it before I see it on the news stands or at least the same day."
2041.3."Essence Magazine Review ESSENCE magazine is one of the finest magazines for progressive Black women and occasionally for Black men. I recommend a subscription to my friends, family and people who want to borrow my copy. The staff, writers and contributors are top notch. Most of the articles are educational, conscious raising and encourages self-growth. The fashion, hair and beauty sections are well done with excellent photo's. As a whole, a subscription to ESSENCE magazine is well-worth the cost."
2042.1."where my copy Cant rate something that I have yet to get a copy of. I feel like I calomst could have done better by going to the store and buying it. I have yet to get my first copy of the magazine"
2043.2."too many ads, not enough interesting material i was hoping to gain some entertainment while reading things that will keep my interest but like most magazines, this was full of ads and the articles either seemed generic or just didnt keep my attention."
2044.2."Could Easily break a tooth So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor."
2045.3."limited multi-function I bought this to replace the cheap one I have which comes with 8 different usb tips, 1 of which doesn't work. Instead of having the same variety of tips as mine, it come with 6, 4 of which are 2 telephone and 2 network jacks. The extension cord had too much thought put into it. Instead of the regular ""zipit"" type cord, this is bigger and has both ends of the cord coming out the same side and uses a button to retract the cord. Not a problem just doesn't work for me. The tips are well made and is of sturdy construction, I think the pouch is just stupid. Fortunately I can mix and match the two to cover all of my needs."
2046.2."Zero Resolution I'm sure I am one of a select few that do not appreciate a story that develops great characters and great sub-plots and then ends abruptly. It's almost as though the author got bored and quit - Zero resolution on anything. It doesn't leave me wanting more because I know the same feeling of ""What the Hell?"" will be waiting for me in the next book."
2047.4."Inventive and Refreshing I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this book. Fast paced, detailed characters, original story, and an epic feel make this a great read. I haven't liked other Koontz before, but I guess Kevin J. Anderson helped pull Dean up to his level. I look forward to the continuing story -- especially by veteran writer Ed Gorman."
2048.5.Koontz is always good this book is very good as I have come to expect of Dean KoontzI've been reading his books as long as he has been writing them and am never disappointedI wish the 3rd book was coming sooner but i'll take it when I can get it
2049.5."Best yet! I have always been a fan of Dean Koontz's books and when my flight was grounded and I was to spend the night in the airport, I figured I'd better get myself a book to keep me entertained. That's exactly what this book did. I enjoyed reading it so much that I almost missed my connecting flight back home because I didn't want to put the book down.It's unique, fresh and fast paced. If you enjoyed the original Frankenstein story, you will adore this ""updated"" and more complete modern version. You will not be disappointed!"
2050.2."Ok but nothing great Its not a bad book but I expected more. I didnt find myself locked into it waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to put it down. One thing I didnt like is the chapters are tiny. It doesnt really let you get into one part of the story before its switched to another. I think they did this to imply fast action and keep you always expecting the next thing but it didnt work for me. I wont buy the next book in the series."
2051.5."Not into monsters...unless Koontz is The Creator One has suggested the Decaulion character lacked depth. Another has hinted that the ending lacked surprise (must have been reading a different book). Remember two things: Koontz wrote it, and it's Book One. We will get into the mystery of the original ""monster"" (Decaulion) and we readers will find many surprises and twists as the story continues to unfold.That being said, I loooooved this book. This is a fun, intriguing look at the evil Doc Frankenstein, who was certainly a monster before chopping his own body up to become yet more so. Dr. F., impervious to aging and disease after 200 years, has been a busy bee, building and perfecting more monsters. But things are starting to go terribly wrong for New Orleans and for the Doctor we love to hate.Read it, you'll love it."
2052.4."3.5 Stars I struggled with how to review this book. As usual I picked up this book, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein book 1, when I was traveling somewhere to read and take my mind off the flight. It worked and the book was good. But really, could they not have made the print smaller and made two books just one book? The book did not have the bite of other Koontz novels, but he did share the writing. It is a bit far fetched, but it is a good update on the classic work Frankenstein. Overall - B JVD"
2053.5."Koontz is getting even better over time. This is a wonderful twist on the classic. The characters are very well rounded and I was grabbed from the beginning. I now and then ponder how the biologically impossible events in the book could actually be brewing in someones own lab at this very moment. Mr. Koontz takes today's traditional underdog and makes him not someone to pity but someone to perhaps admire. My only negative on the book is that I am hooked and will make sure I quickly purchase the next in the series.If you like seeing the dark side of life let in a little light, you will undoubtedly become a Koontz addict as have I. Don't plan on doing anything else until you finish this one.I also highly recommend THE FACE. Another dark side trying to usurp the light. Excellent, excellent, excellent books."
2054.5."Koontz's BEST book I have to admitt that I am not as big a book reader as I used to be. However, when I saw this book in the store I couldn't resist.The idea of making a remake of the classic book was exciting and possibly to like the original. Let me tell you upfront that this book was GREAT!!!! It is the fastest I've ever read a book (4 days); I could not put it down. This book is very direct in the plot, and easy to follow the chapter changes. Koontz writes the characters in a way that you can truely understand exactly what they're feeling, and you can sympathize with even the dubious villians. I hope you take the time to read this book, IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!!!PS- The next part to this book is set to be released in July 2005 :)"
2055.4."Great start to a ""Mimi-Series"" Frankenstein I'm pleasantly suprised. I have read K.Anderson 'novelizations',and been a long time DK fan, and so far I am really enjoyingthe series. I wont re-iterate the Editorial Write-Up. You canalso go to DK's web page and get a synopsis of all the maincharacters. Looking forward to the next installment."
2056.2."Give me an ending A decent story that gets you to turn the pages. The problem is, there aren't enough pages. The story just ends leaving you in the middle of an action sequence. I don't like paying $8 for a book that leaves you forced to buy the next one in a series. I don't mind series (thought I'm not that much into them), but each book in a series should stand alone."
2057.4."Best Frankenstein Story that I have read The idea to keep the original story intact and just bring us a new chapter 200 years later is just great! The story, as usual with a Koontz book, unfolds at break neck speed. I mean it never lows down, right up to the very last page! Be forwarned, there is nothing that even comes close to closure in this book. Its as if they wrote the entire story and picked the most suspenceful parts and end the book there. Then smiling , they watch as we anxiously wait for next volume to come.If you like Koontz, horror or SiFi please go out and get this book. But take one word of advice, you may want to wait till we are a little closer to the release date for the second book. I'm in anguish knowing I have to wait four months!"
2058.2."Disappointing! The repetition of information and slow pace gave this book the feel of elementary school reading material. This series could have been condensed into one book and it would have been the better for it. I gave it two stars for the infrequent plot twists that got me through the book rather than throwing it away."
2059.1."It's Garbage. Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his ""perfect race"" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and ""at one with the universe"" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole ""story"" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."
2060.2."Not Dean Koontz's best This Frankenstein series started off with 3 1/2 stars and deteriorated downward with every new volume. Not up to Mr. Koontz's standard of edge of your seat, nail biting suspense I've come to love."
2061.4."Awesome.... This is my first Dean Koontz novel, highly suggested reading by my mother of all people! I really enjoyed this story of a modern day Frankenstein monster created by an even bigger monster. There were quite a few stories intertwined in this book, all presumably leading up to an ending.Which brings me to why I did not give this book 5 stars. While it was very well written and edited, it was left with a huge cliffhanger. I understand this is part of a series but I personally prefer for a book to be somewhat wrapped up before going onto the next one. This book just suddenly ended in the middle of a scene. Anyway, I'll be getting the rest of the books (of course!), because I know good quality writing when I see it."
2062.4."LOVED IT! This was a great read! The mad scientist return & theres so much mystery its very intriguing. However, I did find it to be a bit confusing with so many charecters to keep up with in order to understand the whole storey & how it meshes into Frankenstien but Im glad I read it :)"
2063.3."Prodigal Son- Dean Koonz Not the usual Koonz intrigue, but I can see that it would have made a great tv series. Rather predictable, but no more so than ""Supernatural"". I'll buy the series anyway. Koonz entertains and leaves each book begging for more of it's ""heros"""
2064.3."The Prodigal Son I've wanted to start this series for over a year now, so the anticipation could have led to my disappointment.While the ending of the book was pretty good, it took a long time to get there. There were a lot of characters introduced and I spent most of the book trying to figure out why. It became apparent towards the end, but the journey was a little disappointing to me. I wanted more of Deucalion as he was a very vivid character to me, but he was barely in the book. I have a feeling that the next book in the series may be a little more exciting so I'm going to give it read. I just hope that we've had enough back ground information given in Prodigal Son so that City of Night can be the page turner I'm hoping for."
2065.4."A New Look at an Old Story I'm not much of a Dean Koontz fan; his tendency to use `deus ex machina' to resolve plots and such has always put me off. I'm also not much of a fan of the horror genre anyway, so I rarely read Koontz. However I had heard a bunch about this series, including the rumor that Martin Scorsese had at one time expressed in interest in producing it for TV. Anyway, I was really kind of glad to read this and see that Koontz had put a little life and a novel twist to the old story. I'm actually looking forward to the next two parts."
2066.5."Dean Koontz's Frankenstein I have loved Dean Koontz for years but his books of late have gotten away from the reason I fell in love with his stories... All I can say is HE'S BACK! I can't wait for the 2nd book!! I could not put this down,it made me breathless the whole way through!"
2067.3."Good story but uneven I enjoyed the story but there were uneven parts that didn't contribute to the story and just felt thrown in. In addition, I was often glad that I was reading this story on my Kindle because I needed to look up several unfamiliar words and some words were so far outside of common use that they were not even in the Kindle dictionary."
2068.3."A GOOD STORY This is a good story with an interesting twist to the plot.But...cliffhanger ending indeed.I like my books to have an ending.I do not like to have!! to read the next book in the series to find out what happens to the characters in the current story.So do not start this series if you do not have in hand all 3 books.Rachell Youngman"
2069.4."Koontz nailed it! I'd only read the first three Odd Thomas books of Koontz's, but thought I'd try Frankenstein, because the review on Amazon said it was not a rehash of the old tale. And, it wasn't. It's a refreshing twist on the resurfacing of the madman (he was never destroyed, and actually resents that Shelley woman's story), but with a clean dash of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a pinch of James Lee Burke's detective angle, all with a flavor of hi-test horror. I'm starting on Vol 2 tonight!"
2070.5."Forget Mary Shelly Well actually, no. Of course not. Nothing can top the original. But Koontz comes at this classic tale with his own scythe ready to cause a change of faith in the fans of the original. This is not so much a remake as a supplement to the classic tale. Koontz references the story we all now and simply fast-forwards to our time, keeping the original Victor and his monster, and giving them longevity.The prose is ellegant and the speed is neck-breaking. It appears that Mr. Koontz uses 'big' words and paints detailed scenarios that may intimidate some readers, but I challenge you to read his work out loud - you'll see how nicely the words roll off your tongue."
2071.5."A better Dean Koontz I've always liked Dean Koontz. This one however is different from his others. It is still a fast read; I found hard to put down. I have already ordered the second and have started on it. This is one saga I won't want to end."
2072.3."Not Exactly What I Thought . . . A pretty decent story. However, the book was marketed (in my opinion) as a retelling of the classic tale with a new ""spin"" on things. This is not the case. In actuality, this is a CONTINUATION of the classic tale, pulling Dr. Frankenstein and his monster into the present day."
2073.1."Don't bother Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter. I kept trying to see if this would eventually grab me, but after maybe 10 chapters or so of plodding prose, I gave up. Thank goodness it was a library book."
2074.4."A solid, entertaining effort, if not Koontz's best Book one of Dean Koontz's FRANKENSTEIN is a solid, entertaining read. I don't know if it should be taken as a conpliment or criticism of Koontz or Gorman, but I really couldn't tell which parts had been written by Koontz and which by Gorman (or whether Gorman wrote the whole thing, in the style of Koontz).Anyway, it's not Koontz's most original or forceful storytelling, but it passes the page-turning test. It kept me hooked until the end, and had me wanting to read the continuation in the second book.Koontz's FRANKENSTEIN lays bare, to a heightened extent, many of the faults and virtues of Koontz's writing in general. The novel is extremely readable, but it suffers from a patness of character and plotting. It's a good book, but not a great one.Still, a good book's a good book."
2075.2."A good story but not great I love Dean Koontz. This was not my favorite. In fact I was rather unhappy with the whole book. Now don't get me wrong he is a great writer but this book bored me. I don't read to get bored."
2076.5."book This is a gift for Christmas. I'm sure they will enjoy it. Had a hard time finding these books. Thanks"
2077.1."Fine until it started eating tapes Like many of the other reviewers, my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous ""Remove cassette"" message and is mangling tapes. I have used it to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years. Search the web for ""canon zr users group"" and ""eating tapes"" to hear similar horror stories. Stay away from Canon camcorders."
2078.3."Lights, lights, lights Video gets grainy indoor. Other than that, i think everything is fine for the price i paid. 8/"
2079.2."Neat package but very grainy indoor quality Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc."
2080.3."OK entry level Camera I just purchased my ZR40 and I think it just barely gets by. The still photos are very grainy and in low light scenarios it does not perform well. The digital zoom is out standing, and it is very handy. I&#65533;ve only had it one week so I can&#65533;t say every much yet."
2081.1."My [Goodness]!!!! world.....do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted [money]buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing [for less]including firewire, 4 dv's, and a carrying caseIt is honestly the worst, disgusting, and despicable electronic out thereif you get this you will have literallyliterally threw [your money]into the atlantic oceanDO NOT GET THIS EVEN IF SOMEONE PAYS FOR IT. RETURN IT. GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!"
2082.2."Horrible motor noise Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera. I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it, so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it. I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera, but I figured I try it anyways. I bought it at Best Buy (should be called Worst Buy), and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise. You can't hear it while recording - it's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it. The motor noise is recorded in with your audio, so you hear a loud hummmm in the background. It was too loud for me to live with. If I was recording something with no background noise (like my baby playing), then it was as loud as his voice! ... I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound. We'll see..."
2083.3."sound issues We have had the camera a week and did some taping indoors in a quiet room. When we did the playback through our television the sound was awful. The noise of the motor on the tape is very loud and distracting. We have heard better sound on older VHS camcorders. Is it because the camera is so small? Is there a fix for it? This has yet to be determined as we plan on calling Canon about it. We have read other reviews of other Canon models and also similar Sony camcorders with the same complaint. Sorry, but for this much money the sound is totally unacceptable. If you buy it we recommend taping a short bit and hooking up to your TV to see how it sounds before it is too late to return."
2084.1."always ""remove the tape"" message I bought this model 18 months ago. Now it has big problem. I can't rewind the tape well. ""remove the tape"" mesasge always pop up. I sent it back to Canon for repair. They asked me $169 for repair. What can I say now? Too bad camcorder."
2085.1."Awful Company. Awful Product. Run! Run! Run! Well where do I begin? After a month of use, the battery stopped working. Contacted Canon via email. They replied battery is not under warranty. Would you like to buy another one? Please.6 months later. I started transferring video to my computer only to find out this stupid camera eats tapes. I have lost two tapes so far. One of them was my son's birth!!!!The eating tapes issue is a major problem with this unit. They have known about it and continue to ignore it. Do a search on ""zr40 tape problems"" to see what I am talking about. There are even more results on sister product, zr10. I will never buy a product from Canon again. They are idiots for doing this to their customers."
2086.5."Great Camcorder Excellent camcorder, does very well in all kinds of light. I have had no trouble with it indoors, and I find that it performs very well in low light. Flawlessly performs with Windows Movie Maker 2 through firewire. The sound is outstanding, considering the picture is it's strong point. I did not need the digital camera built in as I already have one. Effects are fun to play around with, especially with the handy scroll button. I have not heard the motor noise at all, so I can't see where that is coming from. My only complaint is that it shuts off too quickly if inactive, but it's really not that much of a problem. Image stablizer works really well, as I often have an unsteady hand but it is hardly noticeable with this camcorder. I just wish they made a VCR that could record the footage as well as it was taped!"
2087.1."Worst Product I have Owned As many others have reported, this Zr40 began eating tapes with only a few hours of use on it. I have lost many precious moments recorded on tape because of the tape loading problem.The only good thing I can say about this camera is the bag was large enough to hold my Nikon P100. The Canon is going in the trash."
2088.4."Great camera for the money I have used the camera for a month and am impressed by its features and picture quality. I agree with the other reviewers that indoor shoots require good lighting. I bought a video light and it helped a lot. Outdoor footage with sunshine is superb! If you are new to the video world (like I am) this camera is all you need to get started."
2089.5."Great Music, and A Lot of It, At A Great Price This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music, and the title track is the final piece, a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said, the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like, but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties, besides being the first, this one is more immediately accessible, because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work, not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell, 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City', less cerebral than Cecil Taylor, and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension', but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world."
2090.5."Different isn't always good--sometimes it's better I'm a commercial pilot and flight instructor. I read many aviation related books and magazines. I don't often read books that contain a lot of poetry, which AIR FARE does.(It also has short stories and excerpts from longer works.) So to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little wonder of a book is an understatement.My advice? If you've never flown but wonder what it's like, you should read this book. If you have flown as a passenger, you'll recognize your own emotions, both good and bad, in every page. If you are a pilot, you'll see yourself reflected in myriad indelible images; you'll be drawn back by memory to a hundred different experiences; and you'll want to read-and reread-each and every privileged glimpse into the human heart of flight, and be left wanting more. It's a must-have for any aviator's library. Get it!"
2091.3."Right on the money but hard to read I give this book three stars because everything the author says is right on the money. I did not give it 5 stars because the book is repetitious and the language rambling. I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I had trouble finishing it. I would have liked less preaching about liberating yourself and more insights on how to do it from examples of people who have done it. There are examples, but not as many as I would have liked, and not described in enough depth.I gained more insights from ""Gifted Grownups"" by Marylou Kelly Streznewski. Her section about the physiology of giftedness, in particular, covered material I have not seen anywhere else.In the end, how much you enjoy this book will depend much on how comfortable you are with your giftedness. If you have not become comfortable with being ""different"", you will probably value this book. If you are comfortable with the real gifted you, this is probably not the book for you."
2092.5."Give a copy to your teenage children! Read this book as soon as possible. It is so jam filled (malaprop intended) with wisdom and knowledge and so well written with passion and power. Give a copy to each of your teenage children, nieces and nephews! They need this stuff at as young an age as possible.And once you've read it, you must readYour Own Worst Enemy: Breaking the Habit of Adult Underachievementwhich gets down to the nitty gritty of breaking the bad habits that gifted people edge into because of their own gifted pride."
2093.2."Anesthesia for the gifted I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains."
2094.2."Mediocre This is a mediocre book at best. The tests give you an illusion that you are a genius too. It is full of self fullfiling falacies. If you think you are a genius, you are... maybe not. Just review your scores on the SAT, GMAT, GRE, or whatever test you have taken. If you did not score in the top percentile, don't call yourself a genius because the tests within these books said so. That is if you don't want to embarass yourself in public, or even in private company.There are far better books out there on how to train and develop your multiple intelligences. This is not the one.Check authors like Michael Gelb, Tony Buzan, Thomas Armstrong, Howard Gardner, and David Coleman. They have developed a ton of serious well researched materials and methods on this subject. They all provide far better stuff than this book."
2095.2."I was promised new!! well, they promised me ""NEW"" but this book is far from being new. Marking all over the book means it's not new, the cover torn at some parts means that this isn't new!!"
2096.5."A fine novel about a forgotten time Houston exaggerates for effect--not all of the historical characters that he uses were actually at Bisbee. But how could anyone resist using the bigger-than-life leaders of the IWW?"
2097.3."Nothing new At all, the CD is ok, but before it was published I expected that there would be more new songs on the CD. Except for two, all songs are old ones from older CDs. That's not a reason to give a bad rate, because some songs are much, much different and better than the studio songs from the older CDs."
2098.5."Works Great! The shorter length of this rod is exactly what we needed for our shower. Tension rods in this length are difficult to find and we were glad to buy this one. Great product."
2099.4."Good Product Works great, looks more classy than the plain white ones for curtain hanging and it's strong enough to hold curtains. The end piece was a lot smaller than I thought. I thought it would be maybe 2.5 inches in diameter, but it's only about 1. (I didn't measure it.)"
2100.2."Not exceptional As other reviewers have stated, these curtain rods will not sustain much weight at all. They really aren't spring rods - you just twist it into place.I ordered 3 and they were so poorly packed that two of them were bent and completely unusable.I wouldn't bother with these, or buy them from Country Curtains because you can get an anchor so that they can hold more weight and be more stable. Of course, their $30 each instead of $19!!!!"
2101.1."shipped wrong color I ordered three rods (all black) of various sizes and received free shipping. When the order was received, one of the rods was in pewter. They agreed to send a return shipping label for the incorrect item, but I would have to pay shipping on one rod."
2102.4."From Back Cover The Man Who Came for Christmas...The last thing Peggy Jo Riley wanted this holiday was a hard-boiled charmer in her house 24/7. But if she wanted to stay alive, she needed Jack Parker. And once she was in Jack's well-muscled arms, she realized just houw much she needed him...Up until the moment he'd seen desire flicker in her pretty eyes, bodyguard Jack Parker had thought Peggy Jo Riley was just another assignment. But the vulnerability he'd glimpsed under his cool beauty's armor made him ache to do a whole lot more for Peggy Jo. Like kiss her till she gave him her trust. And love her til she gave him her heart..."
2103.4."Dainty This item is very beautiful and dainty, but a lot smaller than I thought. The stones could also be better, but the design is so catching that it makes up for it. I should also add that Charoite is a very hard stone to find at a good price, so if you are looking at affordable, this is it. Trust me, I spent several hours searching. Overall I really like this pendant."
2104.5."Recommend for young musicians This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration. It tells a brief story in an easy to read format for each musician for a variety of instruments. Good for those who have the potential to go professional."
2105.4."interesting reading When you see an orchestra perform it look like the people in it play effortlessly. This is not the case. They get to be that great through LOTS of practice! In Meet the Musicians we are introduced to 15 member if the New York Philharmonic. They tell us there stories of how they found out they really wanted to be professionals.The book included a helpful glossary and a list of resources for learining.Young musicians will gain useful advise from the pro in this book."
2106.3."Massacre at Fort William Henry. A little history about the novel & especially the movie,""Last of the Mohicans"" The book tells about the historythe the war they were fighting and the why about thehorrific massacre scene on the trail from Fort WilliamHenry in the movie."
2107.5."Delightful - Magic and Romance Ghosts, Time Travel, Fairies, Magic and Scotland figure in this delightful story. I liked it. I had one little wish -- I got a bit confused with the love scenes - wish they were a little more detailed and longer."
2108.4."good fantasy romance This book, though not ""great literature"", is a fun read, with plenty of romance and suspense. But you have to be willing to temporarily (for the duration of reading the book) believe in magic, including magical time travel, to let yourself get into the story. This book does have an engrossing, suspenseful story line in addition to the romance, so it is much better than those romance books that are simply an evolving romance held together by boring daily life events. I recommend it as good entertainment reading."
2109.1."Long and involved Had a hard time following the story. Typos in dates really had me confused Malcolm was introduced in 1864 not 1964."
2110.4."Credit for a good cause...but not 5 stars. This CD gets two stars for the good intentions and two for a couple good songs, but not worthy of five stars. I hate to be critical of charity efforts, but it just doesn't have that extra spark. None of the mixes especially strike me as really creative or original. I do love the dance version of Barry Manilow's ""Could It Be Magic"" and Sting's ""Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot"", and a couple other songs are worth a listen, but there are other CD's that I like better. For a great CD with some cool mixes that just blend together like you wouldn't believe, try Fire Island Classics (I like #1 best). For party music, the oddly-titled ""Gay Dancing"" is a really great mix of familiar songs. Dance with Angels is all well-known names and some great songs, but again, the mix just doesn't do much for me as a dance mix."
2111.1."The music is old and tired at this point. The music has been out. What is the purpose of it? Forget it"
2112.4."Pretty Good Pretty good manga.I'm in my twenties and this is one of the mangas I've really enjoyed.Its not like MARS :(But still good!"
2113.2."Just Unnecessary As any fan of Nirvana is well aware, Kurt Cobain had a fear that was close to outright paranoia about Nirvana's music being milked and exploited to make a buck. All of a sudden, that fear seems totally legitimate.This is (basically) the 3rd ""Greatest Hits"" cd that's been released under the band's banner. Nirvana only had three studio released cds. Well ... four if you count 'Incesticide.'If you're a younger fan and you want a terrific introduction to the band's work save your money from cd and save up for the 'With the Lights Out' box-set. It doesn't cost too much and is a great way to break into the band.A true Nirvana fan understands that the only meaning behind this piece is dollar signs."
2114.2."Buy the box set instead of this! All it is the summary of the boxset i guess for the budget nirvana fan? the reason i am giving it 2 stars all it had to offer was a track not included in the box set which is the come as you are demo.. the box set is alot more expensive but has alot more to offer than this and you get a decent dvd to watch all in all a buy for the hardcore nirvana fan... also the art work was originally picked out by Frances Bean Cobain and thats a good thing! other than that buy the box set"
2115.2."Poor value for money I agree with most people that this is an un-necessary release. It is an obvious attempt to cash in by the holders of the rights. But on the other hand it is also a cheaper alternative to the 'With the lights out box'. I own the box and can honestly say it is definitely worth the extra money to buy that. This doesn't even offer the best of the box anyway, which it clear states in the title. I only bought this because I like to own anything and everything with the Nirvana name on it. I believe Nirvana are the most influencial band since the Beatles and any unheard recording of the bands I must have.Only hardcore fans will want to buy this, it only offers 3 previously unreleased recording of which only two are any good. 'Sappy' and a 1985 recorded version of 'Spank Thru' which surely must be the first ever recording by Nirvana.As far as value for money goes, this doesn't have anything to offer, sadly."
2116.1."Smells like dollar signs... Have you ever heard the song 'Milk It'? It was written for this exact reason. Or 'Rape Me'? ""Its so relieving to know that your leaving as soon as you get paid"" Francis farmer? You know when you buy this, some record exec is making a buck on a dead persons name. But hey we all know that suicide sells."
2117.2."Ehh The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case."
2118.1."Why keep on going with this crap? It is more of the same, it is more of the one of the worst band that existed. Nirvana was never good, it was music for depressive people. Skip on this one that it is being release to fill the pockets of her stupid daughter and his stupid ex wife. Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the most worst band of all times."
2119.1."""True"" Nirvana sucks I'll tell you what's REALLY in the spirit of the band: that FBI seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are ""illegal"". Not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway. If this is ""true"" Nirvana, then ""true"" Nirvana sucks."
2120.1."garbage Complete garbage, the sound quality is horrible, if your going to release a best of cd, record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a wet rag."
2121.1."Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn't Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was."
2122.3.please understand If you are just starting to listento Nirvana or you are not a big fan dong get this get Nevermind or any other of thier cds these are thier demos and home recordings and basicly only a few are worth listing to like Sappy - Rape me- Old Age-Do Re Mi-and most of them the guitars sounds bad and untuned and the qualitly is bad but if you are a die hard fan check out the songs u have never herd
2123.1."Completely Useless I don't quite understand why Courtney is allowed to put these things out, and even more surprised that the other members agreed to it (since they have to). Everyone who already put out the 50 bucks for the box gets a whole three song bonus, songs which don't even sound like anything special. Nirvana was an awesome band who made some of the greatest music of all time, and this CD does reflect that. It's a good CD, but it's useless. It's nothing we don't already have. If they're going to put more Nirvana stuff out, it should at least be stuff we haven't heard. Just buy the three songs off of iTunes or something and save yourself the money from buying this CD."
2124.3."OK Album I am a HUGE fan of Nirvana and own every album. I have to admit, I own the ""With the lights out"" box set but I still bought this album, for the three bonus tracks not released on the big box set."
2125.1."Tasteless Trash If I could give this half of a star I would. I am a big fan of Nirvana, but this was a total disappointment to me. The tracks sounded awful. I felt like I was ripped off in every sense of the way. I took it to a buy-trade-sell place and not even they would offer me anything for it, which shows you the poor quality of this album. A word of advice; DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
2126.1."$ Scam The songs on Sliver are easily some of the best of the box but the completely ignored some of the best, also. Its said for me to watch the ""Nirvana Corp."" aka Courtney Love to do something like this. Ultimately, if you don't realize that this is a shtik for $ then you must be confused. Nirvana released a best of cd and then a best of the box? Im just guessing but i think this is what the record company was saying:""We'll throw a couple new songs on it and we'll get some true fans to buy it just to have it.""It's been released for the cash. And this is something I know Kurt wouldnt have approved of. Hopefully someone takes this into consideration before buying it. yea,its good for the collection but its sad to see this is happening. I bought it for the cover art and stuff just to have for the collection nothing more. If your looking for some music get the actual box set."
2127.1."Don't Buy This is the worst recording of Nirvana I have ever heard! The entire thing sounds horrible. DON'BUY IT!!"
2128.2."Thought I was missing more than this... I don't own the box set but, if this is the best of the box then I'm not missing much. I really like Nirvana but there really just aren't many winners here especially since this is suppose to be the pick of the litter from ""With the lights out"".There are a few solid tracks here but I just expected more..."
2129.3."ironic Back in '86-'87 when I was introduced to Nirvana, I thought, ""Okay,another punk revival band from the PNW. Not bad, not particularly good.""So, when they went and got themselves all Butch Vig'd out andcommericial, it was just another reason to distrust ""production value.""Sure, there were some great SubPop bands, (how about The Posies on thesub-SubPop label Pop LLama!) but for the most part they were adistraction. Essentially, the irony is that for most music fans under,say 35, this revamped box set is a marketing slap in the face. Inactuality, it's probably the best way to approach Nirvana. They SHOULDbe remembered as a punk garage act as oppossed to the ""ground breaking""grunge band that unfortunately popped-up punk. The clean sound of""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and it's subsequent effect on popular music isa sad comment on the commercialization of a musical genre that wasalways a humorous, irreverent form with a DIY ethic. Take Nirvana atface value, that's what you'll get with ""Sliver."""
2130.3."The Adolescents-'Complete Demos 1980-1986'(Frontier) Until I got this disc,I've never even heard of this Southern California hardcore punk band,which existed between 1980-1989.Total of sixteen tracks.Even though it's cutting room floor material,the music is decent.I usually enjoy hearing a band's demos ANYWAY.I know that many fans out there don't.Sometimes a demo CAN sound better than the actual lp version.Tunes that had me leaving this CD in my 'current rotation stack' were ""Black Sheep"",""No Friends"",""Wrecking Crew"",""Do The Eddie""(good guitar playing)and ""Richard Hung Himself"".Line-up:Tony Reflex-vocals,Frank Agnew-guitar,Steve Soto-bass and Casey Royer-drums.Should appeal to fans of Bad Brains,Fugazi,Fear,Minor Threat and Agent Orange.Enjoy!"
2131.3."Not Bad Five of the best tracks here have previously been tacked onto the great ""Live 1981 and 86"" cd. If you already own that, you're left with some early, bratty basement or garage recordings of first-set songs that got quickly dumped from their repertoire, which are interesting but not too listenable, and a few more pre-Blue album demos, including the awesome ""Creatures"" and ""Amoeba"". A worthy purchase for those tunes alone, in my opinion."
2132.1."Very easy to solve! This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Buy the ""original"" ""Don't Break the Bottle"", it will keep you entertained much longer."
2133.3."Intresting i got this as a gag gift for my bf's mom. Took her a little bit to figure out. When she got the wine out, we put it back togehter and passed it around! it's a pretty cool gift!"
2134.4."studded latigo dog collar Product was as advertised. Very high quality. Product arrived in less time than anticipated. My dog Buddy looks very sharp wearing this collar. I would highly recomend company and product to anyone seeking a high quality leather studded dog collar."
2135.5."Sensiblity and jarana. The fisrt time I fist met Son de Madera on a live show in the city of Oaxaca, Mex. It's a very talented group, originary from the state of Veracruz, they made a ""rescue"" of the original Jarochan Son, Laura's voice its one of the best of Jarochan Son. their music leads you to tropical and apassionated world of the mexican jarochan soul.La primera vez que conoci a Son de Madera fue en una presentación en cico enla ciudad de Oaxaca, mex. Son un grupo talentoso originario del estado de Veracruz. Ellos hicieron un ""rescate"" del son jarocho original. La voz de laura es una de las mejores del Son Jarocho. Su m'sica te conduce al tropical y apasionado mundo del alma Jarocha de México."
2136.4."In spite of age, still a good reference on the subject In spite of the age of this work, and the fact it was directed to a young audience, it is well written and contains a great deal of useful information. Indeed, until very, very recently it was the ***only*** book that had any useful data on Dark Age warriors. Fortunately, more recent scholarship has come in to help fill the gap, but this is still a very useful work.Amazingly, it has not been reprinted with the rest of Oakeshott's series on Knights - why, I have no clue, for it is the best of the series that I have seen thus far, and is still extremely useful.Buy this if you can, which will not be easy unless a reprint is made - I lucked into a copy from Bookfinder and counted myself quite blessed."
2137.4."Oakeshott was a Scholar While this is not one of his major books and written a long time ago Oakeshott got the details right according to what was known about the subject then, and it's a good introduction now decades later. I have his major books and most of the books written for young folks too. I read what others had to say about this book and I wasn't disappointed in it when I bought my own copy. It's a pleasant read and it filled a niche in our research books.Thirty years in reenactment societies..."
2138.1."Really bad.... This is by far the worst movie in black cinema. Take everything you liked about ""Friday"", ""Booty Call"" and ""CB4"", leave them out of this movie and this is what you get. 90 minutes of [stuff]. It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive ""dancer"".. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep."
2139.4."Palabras de aliento para tu caminar con Dios Una vez mas Charles Swindoll llega al corazón del cristiano como tu y como yo. Nos alienta y nos da enseñanza de como enfrentar nuestros Gigantes, reconocer su origen y escudriñar en nuestro corazón para dar con esas espinas que han estado clavadas por mucho tiempo e impide que nuestro caminar con Dios sea firme. Prácticos y profundos principios para ayudarnos a ser mejores en nuestra casa, trabajo y en la iglesia."
2140.5."Spiritual Fitness An inspiring read which has the potential to change your life providing you actively apply the principles."
2141.4."Mostly a Climbing Book Great book if your looking for climbing routes - Class 3 to 5. The book does not offer signifcant insights into hiking routes in the Wind River Range. You can find better hiking intel on the web with Google searches.The Southern and Northern Wind River Maps also work better to plan out hiking trips.With that said, if your looking to rope up and bag a peak, this book is a must."
2142.2."E.A.'s reveiw I bought this book for my book club and I have had a very hard time reading it. The characters are too life-like in my opinion for me to have any sympathy towards them. I have read other novels from the Victorian Period that I have liked, but this one seems overly wordy and dull in my opinion. I gave two stars instead of one for the mini novel Indian Summer of a Forsyte, the best part of the series, which saved this from a one star reveiw. It was touching and beautiful to read. If only the rest of the books followed such a formula."
2143.5."enough with the exclamation points already! mr. galsworhy may have written a fine solid substantial novel, byt by heaven mr. anthony trollope who lived and wrote over fifty years before was a much more modern writer and didn't qualify every goddam sentence with an exclamation mark. (!) very dated stuff. who knows, maybe one day i'll get past all those damn exclamation marks."
2144.4."Long but interesting I got interested in reading this book after viewing the Masterpiece Theater showing of the Forsyte Saga. It was interesting to compare the movie's interpretation of the book, and it gave a little more insight into the motivations of each of the characters. Overall a good book."
2145.4."Who said the rich had it all? This is a great soap opera sprawling a number of generations from the 1800's to the changing times of the 1920's & 30's. Through this novel we can see the changes that took place in society where money was no object. There is love, lust, adultery, death, birth and friendship. We find in this novel that those with money during this early times were not suffering with the problems of monetary poverty but that of emotional poverty. There are standards to uphold and mistakes are made and status can suffer.You will love this novel, it is a classic and certainly better than any mini series."
2146.5."High Quality One of my favorite gifts I have gotten! These are exquisite and top quality glasses! I remember my Great Grandma had these in the Fire King/Anchor ""Coronation"" that is what attracted me to them. They are so beautiful and would work for any function. I plan on having them for a long time since they are such good quality. You cannot go wrong with this reproduction!!! Especially if you are into Cottage or Shabby Chic home decor. Go for it you wont be dissapointed!"
2147.5."Excellent Excellent karaoke CD. We love it and the music of Abba just makes us happy! Recommend highly - nice collection of songs."
2148.5."Great cable I was able to plug this cable into my video camera and download my videos in HD. This allowed me to see my videos in true HD and not just SD."
2149.3."not a review: A QUESTION Can you tell me if this firewire/i.LINK cable will connect properly to a digital8 camera, from Sony? I have heard that with a firewire you can connect a digital8 camera with no problem and it will upload automatically, with no software. Since I am seriously considering purchasing a DCR-TRV280 Digital8 Handycam I need to know what I have to get for the best ease of use.This was confusing though because the wire is not included in the purchased material, and it does not indicate which wire should be used although it does say it can be. I hope someone help tell me what's going on because I don't have very much experience in dealing with anything but USB cables."
2150.5."video cable Easy way to get video from a digital video camera to your computer. You will need a special port on your computer to use this."
2151.4."Great for video transfer! Atlast I can transfer my videos from my HC32 Sony camcorder to my laptop! Works with Toshiba & Dell laptops, not sure about others. The iLink/IEEE 1394 port on Toshiba is also called S400."
2152.4."Very good cable This cable is really working with my camera, I am transferring digital 8 to DVD and has been working great, the disadvantage is that the speed is not really better that others no brand cables.I recommend this produt"
2153.5."BEST TROMA SO FAR I thought troma was dead. i did'nt really like tromeo and juilet and i never saw terror firmer. well, as soon as i thought troma was dead the toxic avenger 4 proved me wrong ( and i am very happy about that!). Any way this movie is awsome it is sooooooo gory and has a lot of funny parts, like the retarted rebel, the ""duck"" scene, and the scene where the original melvin makes an appearence!!!!!! It is also very gory and has a head running over scene that gives the one from the first movie a run for it's money. also the scene where toxie kills all of these nazi cops....i also give loyd kaufman cridet for sticking his neck out and making fun of abortion, raceism and others.TROMA LIVES!!!!"
2154.1."BEYOND OFFENSIVE! If you love, care, like, or even have the smallest amount of respect for yourself or another person don't expose them to this garbage! I did not expect a movie with taste, and I enjoy B-movies, tacky gross outs, and off color humor. BUT THIS MOVIE GOES WAY OVERBOARD! The filmakers trying so hard to be shocking they forget to give this flick anything that a decent human being could find enjoyable."
2155.2."One of the lesser Louis L'Amour novels I've read them all, many times over and am a big fan. This one held so much promise for me, describing the culture and life of the Californios. And then he had to inject that mystic story of another world in there....."
2156.3."review of the californios overall, The Californios was a good historical western story, and one of the best westerns i've ever read. the book was set in the 1800s in southern California and Mexico, and used realstic details and events from that time period to add to the plot. it had the perfect cowboy setting - canyons, deserts, mountains, horses, Indians, and outlaws. it also involved things that were happening in the 1800s, including immigration and dispute between Mexico and the US. throughout the book, the author uses these to relate to his characters and makes the suspense of the story a lot better. The Californios has all the basic western themes too - adventure, gunfights, treasure hunting, bandits, and old wise men. it even involves spirits and mystical events to beef up the mystery."
2157.1."Poor support from Plasplugs About four weeks ago, I purchased at a Home Depot in Florida the Plasplugs ""Master Tiler"", model number: DWW180US-BX.I am using it for a porcelain tile installation. The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different ""arbor"" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the ""high glaze"" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the ""all blades except the standard have been discontinued"".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future."
2158.3."Not bad....but don't expect to cut 45 Not bad for a small saw...the 1hp motor cut nicely. The down side to this saw is that the water guard for the blade blocks your view of the cut. I also had to modify the mount for the water guard so that the tile wouldn't catch on the back end. If you want to cut at 45 degrees forgetaboutit....the tool comes with a rip fence but no miter gauge... although it had a miter gauge slot...I had to make my own jig to cut 45 degrees....on the positve side the water tank is pretty self contained and the water guard kept the mess to a minimum...I've rented the bigger saws for larger jobs and ended up cleaning muddy water off the walls. This unit lasted all day with one fill and no spills over the side onto the floor."
2159.4."Master Tiler Wet Saw Review For the cost, this tile saw met my expectations. Following the setup instructions for aligning the fence, the saw performed well cutting tile. While it is difficult to freehand beveled cuts using the tilting table, it worked well when I used spring clamps to attach a guide strip to the back side of the tile that followed the edge of the tilting table. The water reservoir provided a good source of water to the blade, but I found that I had to replenish the supply of water on a regular basis. I bought this saw to be able to diagonally cut 19"" tiles that would not fit in my sliding table tile saw. The quality of this saw is definately much higher than less costly plastic versions. Having used this tool, I would buy it again if I needed a tile saw."
2160.1."Not very good I cannot recommend this tool. When I first used it, I couldn't cut the tile. I then noticed the blade was spinning backwards! When I turned the saw off, and then on again, the blade didn't spin at all. Finally, I realized that I had to ""spin"" the blade manually as I switched on the saw to get it to turn correctly. Not what I expected from a $[$$$] tool. Once I finally got it working, I was still disappointed with the performance. Cutting was very slow, and not very accurate. ..."
2161.2."Spend your money elsewhere... You could do a lot better for the price of this tool. Comparing it to comprable models costing half as much? I recommend spending for the cheaper models or springing for something better. The blade wouldn't align with the blade guard until I modified the table with a file. The tightening bolt that runs through the fence stripped in less than two weeks of light use. (Trust me, I'm not THAT strong.) Spend less or spend more, just don't bother to spend for this tool. One additional note: I contacted the manufacturer about the stripped rip fence and they promptly sent me a replacement without questions. I suppose that's worth an upgrade to 2 1/2 stars. I still think one could do better for the money. Oh, and my saw leaks water continuously when the unit is operating. Better leave it at two stars afterall."
2162.5."Great Value Used this saw to cut 3/8 inch granit tile and it worked better than i anticipated. Had no leaks as others indicated..some mess, yes, but not unusual with tile cutting. The diamond blade lasted throughout the kitchen project but did show signs of wear towards the end. . Certainly a great value!!!"
2163.3."Good for Homeowners Let me start off by saying that this saw has payed for itself many times over for me. I did two bathrooms (walls and floor), hallway, 2 backsplashes, and laundry room floor with this tile.The motor is definitely powerful enough for the job. I cut stone, ceramic, and porcelain with this saw without any problems.The construction is a bit flimsy. The table tilting mechanism is worthless. The worst thing about this saw is the 7/8"" arbor. The only aftermarket blades with a 7/8"" arbor hole are masonry blades that can't be used for tile. You're stuck buying blades from Plasplugs and they don't make a high-glaze blade for delicate glazed tile so you end up chipping the glaze around the cut line.If you're a pro, get a good professional saw - if you need to do a several rooms in your house, this saw is adequate."
2164.1."Very poor This is a very good concept, but poorly executed. On my particular saw, the tilt section of the table didn't fit flush, so it made the right side of the table useless. Once raised to the 45 degree position, the tilt section was wobbly, as one of the flimsy plastic props did not even touch its rest. The blade ran neither true nor parallel to the fence. The blade retaining nut had to be tightened about every 10 cuts. The blade actually flew off the shaft a couple of times. The tile caught on the plastic end caps of the fence, which stick out. I could easily stall the motor with ordinary 1/4 inch ceramic tile. Can't remember all the other thigs wrong with it, I was in too much of a hurry to return it."
2165.1."Buy Something Else! The first tile I cut... I knew I had purchased the wrong saw. Maybe to use the rip fence it would work ok, but to cut tile freehand, it was useless. The blade comes up through the table, like a table saw, with the blade spinning through 1 inch of water in the bottom of the tank. The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched. Bad design. I'm returning it and spending the extra money to get something good."
2166.1."PlasPlug Master Tile Cutter Bought at Home Depot for $199. It is a toy, not suitable for serious work. Flimsy contruction, difficult or impossible to adjust. Recommend getting a brand name."
2167.1."spend the additional money and get an MK My main complaint is the fence, getting both sides square to the blade and locked down will take you about five minute's and even then don't put to much pressure on the fence as it will ether bow or one side will move. An MK is much faster put the tile on the carriage push the tile to the blade make sure the kurf is going to be on the correct side of your mark slide the carriage back set the fence (if you'd like) turn the saw on and cut. I renovate older home and many times the walls are out of square so your cut tiles are going to be getting bigger or smaller as you go God help you if you get into this position with the Plasplugs tile saw...."
2168.2."Bad fence, Bad tilt The rail keeps popping up, so the plastic endcaps are no longer flush with the table. I had to file them down so the tile won't get caught. The tilting table will move apart at the hinge when I start pushing the tile through the blade, it is just useless. Straight cuts seemed to work OK. This may be suitable for small around the house jobs. I think the design is from England. Bad British engineering !!"
2169.4."Seems to Work So far I have no complaints. It seems to be working, but I think in more time, I will know if I absolutely love it. I have low progesterone and suffer from PMDD. My last cycle, my pms symptoms were less pronounced, so I think it is working."
2170.1."made my head spin this made me really dizzy so I had to stop using it after only one use. I ended up tossing it out."
2171.4."It really does help I have been taking this supplement for a while. I only take one a day. I tried not taking it for a week just to minimize the pills I take every day, but I could feel my mood worsen. This is a great product."
2172.1."Didn't help I found research that said this possibly may help get your cycles back and so after finishing the bottle the cycle never came. I guess if you keep it up after a few months is what might help, but I decided instead of buying more and hoping it would help to talk to my doctor first."
2173.2."Caused tiredness and confusion I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex, but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary. After the first week, I only noticed the tiredness increasing. I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange. When taking it during the day, one time, I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to. I'd go through these spells where I felt very heady, like I was going to pass out. I was only taking 250mg per day. I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS, but I couldn't continue with it. This doesn't seem like a common result, but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex's side effects. Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract, but this is something I'm not messing around with any more! Back to progesterone cream!"
2174.4."Jay Hoggard Jay Hoggard is a vibes player who shows a strong affinity for both Milt Jackson and Bobby Hutcherson. His use of the pedal gives him a very warm, dream-like sound - his unaccompanied version of MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE is a good example of that. But he can swing hard, too, as on STARTING OVER, a Bobby Hutcherson tune that also features drummer Yoron Israel. SWEET POTATO is right out of the church, and the group plays a very relaxed STOMPIN' AT THE SAVOY. Guitarist Kenny Burrell plays well on Monk's EPISTROPHY. The only misstep for me is the title track, which is much ""freer"" than the others and has a strong Ornette Coleman flavor to it. Other than that, it's an excellent CD."
2175.5."GREAT for my rosacea I have bought this and also the extra strength. I bought the regular then realize it came in extra strength. I alternate using them and they seem to work the same. This product has taken away 95% of my redness and flaking due to my rosacea. I have really tried everything and nothing worked in the past. Even my skin Dr suggested things and nothing worked. I saw this on a show on NBC and thought I would give it a try and so glad I did. I use it everyday. I am unsure why the price is so much lower on Amazon vs buying it directly from the Dr Gross website, seems odd to me."
2176.3."Not impressed For the amount of time invested and money spent, this product did not live up to expectations. I will not re-order. I noticed very little change in my skin even tho I used it faithfully and according to directions."
2177.3."Nothing Dramatic This product was okay. But, I didn't find a big difference when I added it to my skin care procedures. Secondly, the little pads are too thin - kind of low budget for a $68 product"
2178.1."Expensive experiment that didn't work I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done."
2179.5."excellent product This skincare product has saved my 50+ year old complexion. It's like having a facial every day. Great for anybody, any skintype, even teenagers. Worth the money. Leaves the skin w/ a ""just right"" texture: not dry, not greasy. You can apply make-up right after using the pads."
2180.3."Seeing slow results I used to buy DDF's 30 Days to Radiance, it's a similar concept with 30 pads and 2 different applications. Somehow they discontinued it, so when I went to the Nordstrom makeup counter they recommended trying the MD skincare line. Maybe this particular product works a little slower than DDF and I have to be patient to see great results. But so far in using for a week it's been so-so, I wish DDF would bring back they're product it's amazing. Not sure if this was worth spending $125 for."
2181.1."Horrible product, wish I could give it negative stars.... This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further. If you want to breakout horribly even if you don't normally and to have an awful rash on your face for days, this is the product for you. If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare."
2182.3."Okay but expected more I have been using this product for about three months now. At first, it really seemed to be making my skin tone more clear and radiant. But my main problem is oily skin and adult acne (which is worse at 37 than it was at 17). And MD hasn't helped that at all. My skin is still an oil slick, and I still get frequent breakouts. Dealing with my breakouts has started to really tick me off now that I am spending around $100 a month on the MD skincare system, versus the $10.00 or so I used to spend on Neutrogena or the like. But to give MD credit, I have cruddy skin - large pores, oily all over, etc. I like the clean feeling the pads give me but it just doesn't seem worth the cost anymore. So I am moving on. Going to try Nucelle."
2183.5."SO Expensive BUT... Great product! I have used many a skin care product and this was by far the best one. But because its so expensive i have to buy it sparingly. (Im not a high roller) I have ordered this product twice in the last year and it works right away. The problem is you really have to use them all in 30 days or the pads will dry up on you. This is dissapointing since i really dont need to use them everyday. Nonetheless this product works...if i had the money i would keep a ready supply in my cabinet."
2184.4."Vision of Blindness Here Derrida offers a vision of blindness, that is to say a ""vision"" of ""blindness"", or even a ""vis""ion of ""blind""ness. By deconstructing the very ""act"" of see""ing"", he defers to différance, grammatology, and ""éperons"", that is to say, the ""spurs"" by which we harry, that is to say hurry, the horse(s) of structuralized condescension. Perception, that is, or ""interception"", or even ""interperception"" of vision--or more precisely, visuality, and all that implies. Reading, and re-reading, this book, we can easily understand why Derrida and his thought were so instrumental in the fall of apartheid."
2185.4."published letters - free for Kindle Even well written letters won't contain the whole story. Still I enjoyed the descriptions of life on a frontier. The storms, the relationships, and the culture left me wanting more; but friends can't share everything in letters. That is part of the time period. Intimate feeling but no ""twitter"" details. This free book was worth more than I paid for it."
2186.3."WHEN YOU BELIEVE CD REVIEW NOW THIS WAS ONE OF MARIAH'S LEAST SUCCESSFUL SONG- THE OTHER ONE BEING CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY- BUT IT'S STILL WORTH BUYING IF YOU'RE A COLLECTOR."
2187.5."They fit Perfect.... I think that they are both nice voiced and this Cd is a great combination. A relaxive song with nice music. The only bad thing is that there is only 1 song including in this Cd. Anyway this is great Cd to buy..."
2188.3."It is a piece which i dont really like,but the artist are ok Really i don't love the piece the first time i listened to it,but each time i see the two of them on stage i will be forced to like the the music, so keep on moving."
2189.3."I Feel Bad For Mariah I feel bad for Mariah, she stands no chance going against the BEST DIVA EVER, Whitney Houston.Whitney is beautiful, ridiculously talented, and has the PERFECT VOICE.Mariah is ugly (check out that huge forehead)! and is the most overrated singer in the world.This is an excellent song but Mariah completely ruins it."
2190.2."Movie Version is Much better! The movie version of this song is much better. The Mariah/Whitney version is simply just a screaming contest to see who can sing better. I admit the song is beautiful and touching, but it would have been better if one of them sung it instead of it being a competition. Buy the soundtrack and listen to the movie version. It showcases the song in a much better light."
2191.2."New Age? The song is sung beautifully, but is it promoting New Age? Should we believe in ourselves or in God? I think the focus should be more on believing in God and not just in ourselves."
2192.5."""When you believe"" This song, sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey is GREAT! Sometimes, it leaves tears in my eyes. But, the song has some contrasts. Whitney Houston has one of the most beautiful voices in the universe. So when she sings the first verse and chorus, and then Mariah Carey starts to sing the second verse... it's a HUGE CONTRAST! Mariah screeches... If Celine Dion, who has the most wonderfully beautiful voice in the universe, had sung it with Whitney Houston, the song would've been irresistible. It would have been so unexplainable beautiful. Anyway, great job, Mariah and Whitney!"
2193.4."last minute order I ordered this at the last minute and it arrived on time. The case was cracked but the Cd was undamaged."
2194.4."Informative Read it all of it. can not say that I will use any of it. As a woodsman we usually go out already prepared and with our own more modern and durable gear. maybe if I were to live out there and have to replace my goods as they will inevitable need replacing with the suggestions in this book, but seeing as I am a working class man and will not live n the woods it just is good reading and that is all."
2195.5."great book this is a great book. it was written well and read more like a story and not a manual the information although somewhat dated was great to read about and made me think about how a woodsman would have lived in the early 1900s"
2196.3."Strange.... This is a very strange book. There are a lot of small messages that Mr. Malamud delivers in each of his stories. Everything from the mistreatment of others to stealing. He covers many different aspects of life that can help make people better citizens of the world.I did not enjoy his style of writing though. It was dull, and very dry. There was no excitment in any of his stories and I found it hard to keep myself reading. I can see how somebody else might enjoy it though... if you're the type that likes dull, dry stories, Malamud is the guy for you."
2197.2."BORING! I would suggest before sitting down to read this book that you brew a large pot of coffee. Or better yet, don't sit down to read it at all. This is dry stuff!"
2198.5."Magic Malamud Malamud does three or four tricks in his fiction well, and here he does each one to utter perfection. And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."
2199.4."Interesting This book was interesting. I feel not everyone gets these short stories. The stories are sad and depressing, but that's the author's point: immigrant life can really suck. There isn't always a happy ending. Also, I read this book on my ipad so there were a lot of issues with formatting, which was annoying."
2200.4."The best pocket jujitsu book Small-Circle Jujitsu is the best pocket jj book on the market and also the closest book to traditional, real, ju jutsu. The photos are good (black and white), but the quality of paper can be better (maybe in next edition). All you need for to begin train is in this book."
2201.3."Great book on Jujutsu This book is more useful as training reference for a Small-Circle Jujitsu practioner as while the principle of the small circle is quite interesting and so is Wally Jay's history the book really doesn't cover many principals of grappling in depth.The best books to get to understand the grappling arts isThe Canon of Judo: Classic Teachings on Principles and TechniquesandTotal Aikido: The Master Course (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)as these books go into the details and strategy of grappling arts where as this book is more for advanced practioners."
2202.4."Good if you already know some Jiu-Jitsu As a Marine Corps Close Combat Instrtuctor, I can tell you that the majority of these techniques work well, and may be learned and applied by anyone. I do, however, beleive that much practical application and sparring/grappling against many different opponents is necessary to become proficient in any fighting art. Nearly ALL of the Marine Corps Close Combat techniques are found in this book. As our system was a collaboration of many SME's (subject matter experts), that has to speak for something. In addition, Wally echos one of my main points to my students, do not ever become subbornly commited to one technique. You must be able to flow from one to another based partly upon your skill, but primarily the actions of your opponent. Great book, although the pictures and descriptions could be better for beginning practitioners. If you are familiar with basic Jiu-jitsu techniques and principles, you should have no problems."
2203.3."Small-Circle Jujitsu is just OK I became interested in learning about Jujitsu when I watched Royce Gracie for the first time in the Ultimate Fighting Championships. My interest was sparked even more when I saw Rickson Gracie's video ""Choke"". DO NOT buy this book if you expect to learn the techniques that the Gracies use, because this is a very different style. The book does not deal with any kind of ground fighting...it is strictly stand up combat with a few throws. A lot of the moves would be very difficult to perfect without a partner to practice on, so be sure that you have someone that you can train with."
2204.3."Small Circle or Kodenkan Yawara ? I did not find what I was looking for here. I was hoping to find an entire book on ""Small Circle JuJitsu"" and instead found a book that was 80-90% standard Kodenkan JuJitsu at maybe the Shodan Level and only 10-20% of what I would consider ""Small Circle JuJitsu"". I was 20% satisfied and left feeling empty. Maybe I just lack the experience to understand what his two books convey? But I don't think so!"
2205.2."Alot of decent pictures and instructions As a student of jiujitsu i understood alot of the moves but i found that without previous knowledge these pictures and instructions were difficult to understand. I feel there is alot of good information but not worth buying."
2206.2."Buy a different jujitsu book I bought it before I knew anything. Now that I have been training a bit more and reading more I realized that this book is lacking a whole lot. I do not really recomend this book unless you can get it for free."
2207.1."Total rip off! I ordered this and realized I didn't specify the size so went back 20 min. later to cancel the order and then order another one.the shipping is 3/4 the priced of the item! Then after what I thought was a canceled order didn't even work at all. I have been sending emails all day and tried to call them to no avail. Horrible communication. they took my money and haven't even responded to my email or phone call.Caveat Emptor"
2208.5."The first excellent book ever written about Heinlein Finally, somebody has written a truly useful book about that most important of American science fiction authors, Robert A. Heinlein. In the past, sloppy criticism and the grinding of personal axes have ruined every single attempt to produce a book discussing Heinlein's works (I have the misfortune of having read them all). Gifford has produced what has to be the groundwork for all future studies of Heinlein: a basic categorization and numbering of every single published and unpublished work in the canon, along with the insiders' story on each entry. Readable from cover to cover, or as a reference work, Gifford has also performed the one invaluable goal of every reader's companion: he's sent me back to rereading the original works, but with fresh perspectives and insights. A perfect score, after twenty years of utter failures in Heinlein scholarship. Bravo!"
2209.5."An intelligent, broad-ranging book James Gifford has given us a book immense in its scope, detailing the works of one of Science Fiction's Grand Master, and one of the genre's most prolific authors.The format is very reader-friendly. The individual entries for each work are fascinating for any Heinlein lover, and the bibliography and opus list will prove invaluable to new readers who wish to delve into Heinlein's universe. Truly a landmark achievement in research and clarity."
2210.3."Heavy on process, light on content... Somewhat disappointing for the Heinlein fan interested in detailed summaries and analysis. More useful for those looking for chronologies, timelines, cross-referencing, etc. Still, this flawed Heinlein reader's companion is better than nothing."
2211.4."Good for latin american enthusists- and that's it It has been a while since I read this book (maybe two months), but I just wanted to add to the body of reviews that if you love Latin American fiction or books that might read like the old Masterpiece Theater productions, you'll probably enjoy reading this book, and otherwise you'll probably be bored to tears. The writing is not very sophisticated, as is covered by others. Actually, given the quality of the book, I'm surprised by the number of reviewers! Many better books even in latin american fiction like Belli's The Invisible Woman have far less coverage. However, if you are thinking of buying the book to be well read in this genre(or if you want something specifically on El Salvador), you won't do wrong."
2212.3."disappointing I was very much looking forward to reading this book since it came so highly recommended by a trusted book catalogue. On the positive side, the book gives an interesting account of the historical struggle between the rich coffee plantation owners and the uprising of the poor Indian workers. However, the author fails, in my opinion, in developing her characters beyond the superficial, and thus I remained uninvolved for the most part and detached from all the human tragedies. In summary, Ms Benitez had a wonderful premise for a story, and the history and description of El Salvador are enlightening and in part very beautiful, but the plot and characters ultimately remain shallow and mimick the sub-plot soap opera."
2213.2."disappointing This is our book group selection this month and I was looking forward to a good read, especially judging by the appealing cover. Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to. Jacinta in particular needed some enchancement. It will be interesting too hear what my fellow book club members think."
2214.1."Unbelievable! I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it. What a mess!"
2215.4."An end with a bang This is the first book I have read by Sandra Benitez. I have done much research on the the 1932 matanza in El Salvador and some on the civil war. I am Salvadoran and began reading the book critically and from a historical point of view. It began quite slow for me and somewhat sided, but as I read on I began to feel as I knew the characters and their realities. This is an excellent book. The realities of life, love, family, death, and war are presented strongly and passionately. The ending is gripping and seems unlikely, but definately portrays the difficult times of the civil war. Read it, it will provide a fictional story of the lives of some in a war torn country."
2216.2."Abandoned this one This is about the trials and tribulations of a multigenerational family.We found it disengaging and rather tedious. It went on and on without getting far at the beginning and we started skipping scenes to see if it picked up. In the end we abandoned it.I'd hoped for more from a movie with Saif Ali Khan, Salman Khan & Karisma Kapoor but this was 1999 and I guess it wasn't among their better stuff. The music and dance was ho-hum and unmemorable too.Elsewhere on the Net it scores average. However it was below average for us and not a keeper."
2217.5."great goggles These are the best goggles we have ever tried. They fit well, do not fog up and have a good seal. No rashes from the material. The instructions for replacing the clear lenses with optic lenses are rubbish but once you pop the plastic frame off, the rest is very easy. Ignore the packet instructions and just follow your instincts!"
2218.4."Sounds Like Santa The bells are exactly what you think they are and sound exactly like you think they do. My daughter was THRILLED to be able to make her own Santa sounds. They seem pretty durable and are great for the price."
2219.1."Weak out-dated plans I got this book expecting a bunch of puzzles from the cover and title. There are many other items to be found, but everything looks very out-dated. Definitely keep looking if you want puzzles or other up-to-date patterns.Wayne"
2220.2."Great translation, Poor packaging I love the ESV translation and rate it five stars. I am upset that the publisher of this translation so poorly packages its product. This edition is a ""shirt pocket"" edition that seems well bound but has impossibly small print.What is needed is a ""coat pocket"" size edition of the New Testament that is bound in such a way that it will lie open of its own accord. The print size should be 10 or higher. This present edition will not lie open, and, what the more, the print is so small that only an ant could read it.Crossway publishes only two editions of the New Testament alone, and both are inferior. The print is too small to be read with enjoyment. Something has to change!"
2221.2."Small type My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose."
2222.1."True stem-winder of a novel Really, really awful. The sheer paucity of Alan Dean Foster's imagination is staggering. ""Midworld"" was recommended to me by a friend; at first I thought I was the victim of a bad joke. Could be used as a blueprint on how not to write a novel. Witless, humorless, and lacking in even the slightest glimmer of originality. Don't waste your time."
2223.5."Wonderfrul Creatures No one describes a creature like Alan Dean Foster! Hands down, the very best. His silverslith sent shivers down my arms. I've read it many times, and I even use it to teach my students how to write a descriptive paragraph. His mind knows no bounds when inventing animals, plants, and humans. Probably my favorite fantasy book of all times (though Mid-Flinx) comes in a close second."
2224.5."You'll read this one again and again. This book, like Heinlein's Starship Troopers, is a book I keep reading again and again over the years, and for similar reasons. As previous reviewers have stated, this book is quite compact, yet rich and complete, and operates on several levels. It's the description of a fascinating world. It's an adventure story. It's a character study. It's a parable. The concept is intriguing, and the characters are multi-faceted. It's a compact classic, and until today I hadn't realized that Midworld had shown up in any other books. Those books (all of them) are going on my Amazon Wish List today.Read this book, and read Starship Troopers. Both are SO much more than bugs-in-space. They're worth far more time than they actually take to read."
2225.5."Wonderful world I first read this book as a teenager, many, many years ago, and I still dig it out of my bookshelf every other year to re-immerse myself in Foster's wildly imaginative world. He has such a great talent for inventing intriguing flora and fauna!Only two little flaws come to mind:1. Midworld seems a little too lethal for any colony to survive long enough to discover the Home Trees and make use of them.2. In Mid-Flinx, the author describes fire-extinguishing flora. They apparently don't exist in Midworld because if they did, the corporation couldn't have built their R&D; complex."
2226.4."Prose for thought Beautifully written in prose form, Baldwin writes of race relations, and the awakening of one's mind to the differences, perceived or otherwise, of race, color, and their political ramifications. Very candid, and yet ultimately subtle, too---the book, which is written in the form of a letter, makes one think about the trials that many minorities (primarily African-Americans) go/went through and how far we've come today......and, yet sadly, how much further we have to go. This short book makes you think---with your eyes wide open."
2227.3."Love Stories I enjoyed reading tales of others who were being romantic. Although I was a bit disappointed by the lack of creativity or originality in most of the vignettes. If you are wanting help being romantic, skip this book. If you are looking for a feel good experience, reading about other happy couples, you might enjoy it."
2228.5."Treat yourself & buy it! I'd have to agree with M-Speedy, this album is great! If you enjoy Cyndi Boste this second album won't disappoint."
2229.4."A new target of cutting wit? Jokes can be both funny and cutting, and often it seems that women have been the victims of comedy more often than men. But jokes aside, this book of quotations demonstrates that even if the numbers are not equal, men too have been the target of commentary but amusing and attacking for centuries. The illustrations are simple black & white drawings of a ""Victorian"" style, rather satirically in itself considering the gender roles at that time. The book is organized on the premise that males are a extincted species and this is a pseudo-historical view of them by the survivors, females. The book has five chapters where the quotations are organized by subject and tone. I found it actually quite interesting but not necessarily funny, but them I'm a historian and a feminist so I was over-analyzing the content, I'm sure. I find it to be a good source for bitting commentary when I write some of my fiction."
2230.3."Very cursory overview of being a yearbook adviser- many years ago This book shows it's age, as it is published before computers were involved in the yearbook process. It does contain several good tips and hints, and would be a good option as an introduction for a new adviser, but does not contain much new information even for an individual who already has a year under his belt."
2231.5."My issue isn't with the work of fiction I love the story of Tess. Considering many of the classics I have ever read, I think Tess is one of the easier ones to understand. The work itself is a masterful story. However, I take issue with Penguin's version. The Notes are just awful- referencing back and forth from your place in the book to the back is a nightmare and many times isn't worth breaking your flow. Some of the Notes are helpful and even necessary to understand the sentence, but others are pointless and annoying. I recommend a different version, either without notes entirely or with more reasonable ones."
2232.4."Hardy's Classic Worth the Read This novel, contrary to some of the other comments, is a wonderful piece of literature. Although not the most uplifting, it is a great example of Hardy and Deterministic and Naturalistic fiction. Despite Tess' best efforts (like Jude in the other Hardy novel), she is unable to escape the poverty and misfourtune which she attempts to leave behind. Although somewhat lengthy, the novel is one of the better pieces of British fiction to come out of the period."
2233.5."Just so tragic! I can't believe how tragic this book is! I picked up this book with an unexpected decision. The book I was supposed to read was Queen of the Damned, but then I saw this book and the cover appealed to me. So I decided I'll read it. At first it was kinda boring, until the last 1/3 of the book, I was so depressed by it...how fate was toying with them, and how their characteristic had decided their fate............Anywayz, this is truly a wonderful book, either by plot, writing, background, history, religion, describtion, etc etc, it's all with perfection. Read it, even though the beginning part might be kinda boring, it's for you to understand it better.I'd recommend this book to anybody, and if you like tragedies, you definitely *have* to read it!!"
2234.4."An extremely interesting read. Ok, the first time I too this book out of the library, I got halfway through it before I hurled it at the wall. I couldn't stand the characters and I was so mad and frustrated with them I returned it without finishing it. A month later, it was drivng me crazy not knowing how the characters fared, and I took it out and finished it. But this time, I knew how to read it: I didn't try so hard to relate to the characters, I just read their story. And I found if a fascinating study of suffering and sorrow and love and all that good stuff. So just get throught the very frustrating middle and it's good, really. Strange, gothic ending, but good. And check out the A&E movie, because it's excellent - better thatn the book, and that's weird. Perfect casting and adaptation. Ok, that's all."
2235.3."Depressing This book written in the mid 1800's reads like an opera tragedy. Tess is raped and becomes pregnant and has to deal with the guilt and shame of the living in those times and how it complicates all of her romantic relationships. As modern woman I found the whole story utterly depressing."
2236.1."Can I shoot myself now?? A few years back I was forced to read ""Tess"" for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on ""Tess.."""
2237.1."The book was boring, because of its victorian ideals. Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."
2238.4."Glad I read it, but This year I decided to reread some classics, and read some I never had read. This one was a little tough for me. I'd be reading and have to backtrack few pages for the first time ever."
2239.3."thought i'd try i'm not in love with this book. as classic i thought it'd be better but it drags and drags and drags and there's not much to keep your attention. its very vaguely written and i can tell already i'm not a fan of Thomas Hardy"
2240.4."""Tess"" is a wonderful story of innocents and disapiontment. ""Tess of the d'Ubervilles"" is the story of a young and innocent woman who wants nothing more than to live a happy life. Every time Tess comes close to happiness something goes wrong. By the end of the book the emotional stress of Tess's life is clear, leaving the reader sympathetic to her misfotune."
2241.5."Deliberately frustrating, occasionally profound, great read. About fifteen years ago, this book was almost universally considered Hardy's great masterpiece. However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign. Hardy's gift for creating sympathetic characters seems infinite in magnitude. His prose is unique and at times more harrowing in tone than Conrad's. This book would be a great introduction to the work of one of the great masters of English Literature."
2242.3."Ok book This book was a good book at times and a somewhat boring book at times. I was assigned this book to read for english class. In my class there were those who liked it and those who didn't. I on the other hand thought it to be just Ok. Tess had her moments when you wanted to cheer her on but most of the time was spent looking back to try and understnad what happened, and many times the book was such that it put you to sleep ( which happened to me on 7 occasions ). In all it is not a bad book, but I would not recommend it to younger readers, and if any english teachers are reading this please think about what your students would like to read not yourself and what you think is good."
2243.2."Sorely disappointed The back cover of my book described Tess as a heroine for her time. I was thrilled to begin reading this book to discover what it was that made her a heroine. I was very disappointed by the end of the book. She was no heroine, more like a self-pitying brat! Hardy did a fantastic job of describing life during that periold of time, but that talent was not enough to change my opinion of the book. Very aggrevating!!!"
2244.2."Zzzzzzzzzz..... TESS is one of the more boring works of literature. Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck."
2245.3."Maybe it's just not my style... It seemed to me that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a bit dull at times, but the storyline as a whole was quite interesting. There is a great deal of imagery, so much that I deemed it to be in the way of my actually getting absorbed in the novel. Surprises abound, but they are surrounded by lengthy passages describing everything and anything. Nature, being an important aspect of the novel, receives so much attention, and Hardy expounds upon it so meticulously, that it becomes an effort to read through everything. I was disappointed in the very beginning by this style of narration (actually, thinking of Hardy's other novels, it is very much like him), but by the end, I found it to be absorbing. The character of Tess is very memorable, and awe-inspiring. I recommend this if you have plenty of time to devote to a novel (not looking for a quick read), and if you like Hardy's style; if you do, you'll find this to be a very good read."
2246.3."XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI do not want to rate this at this time. I would like the option to comment if I feel strongly about it one way or the other."
2247.2."Exhausting This book has it's place--and that place is in an American Literature course at a university. It was entirely too technical to be enjoyable. I was assigned this book as a ninth grader and now that I am a teacher and understand lexile levels, I must advise other teachers not to assign this book until the later grades--and only to the highest students."
2248.4."It's OK It was really a great book, but what is Tess's problem?!?She is just too trusting and dependant. And Angel. He's seriously got issues. I mean, come on! He liked Tess just because she was perfect!! DON'T GET ME WRONG, THE BOOK REALLY WAS GREAT!!"
2249.2."Bit of a Letdown in the End This is part of my attempt to read classics and non-fiction as well as my usual speculative fiction this year. A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville."
2250.2."Not a brilliant book but... I didn't like this book very much. It was silly. I'm sorry that I've wasted time reading this book. There are better books to read."
2251.3."Simple This book was not anything special. Although I love romances, it was too simple. The symbolism was spelled out to the readers in a blunt manner. The less educated readers may appreciate it. The wording was quite beautiful at times and the plot was enchanting (perfect for a movie) but it is not heart wrenching like the movie Titantic (which was a must see!) ;)"
2252.2."Glad to be of this century I didn't like the book. The language was difficult to read and in the end the topic was one i don't agree with. The ultra right values where women were always at fault for tempting a man and she was the one dealt final cruel punishment. I am relieved to be of this century. Makes us appreciate what we have and what those before us had to suffer for us to be where we are now."
2253.4."how tess' motherhood experience change her life... Tess, a naive and young girl whose one night relationship with her cousin Alec ruins her life, is a great example of a woman in love who would do anything for her husband and nothing for herself. Tess is a great book to read. I NEED HELP AND SOON IN LESS THAN A WEEK I HAVE A TERM PAPER ON TESS DUE (THE CONSEQUENCES OF MOTHERHOOD BEFORE BEING WED IN ENGLAND IN THE 1800'S AS SEEN IN TESS) PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ANY MATERIAL THAT CAN HELP ME EMAIL IT TO ME. tHANKS IN ADVANCED!!!!!"
2254.4."Good Companion Piece I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall."
2255.3."I may seem like a bubble butt for this, but... ...when you're forced to read something this boring, it doesn't tend to sit well. The simple plot followed by confusing images, muffled transition, and the fact my Senior English teacher thought this was a very good book, well... I wasn't too happy with it. What did appeal to me was the imagery and the character of Tess, who was presented very nicely. (Hence the extra stars <wink>) Sorry if offended anyone.BTC"
2256.2."This book has a dire need to be shortened This book in the beginning was so slow that I finished a book twice it's length before I finished the first chapter of Tess of the D'Urdubervilles."
2257.1."Disappointing I was really disappointed in this book and surprised that so many people think it is a wonderful story. It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier)."
2258.5."Time Well Spent For those beginning to read the classics this one is a great hook. While the characters are complex the story is linear and the allusions are simple enough to follow. One can't help but hope Tess's life will somehow turn out right although knowing it will not. The burdens she encounters seem to do little to stop her from moving forward. Life seems so unfair to her, but Hardy handles her masterfully; indeed it is safe to say Hardy loves her more than God does."
2259.3."Sad classic novel This is a classic novel that is one of the saddest. It involves a very likeable, innocent country girl who is seduced by a cruel employer. She has a child by that union that dies early in infancy. She later meets a man who loves her but upon learning her past rejects her. She then meets up again with the first man, who forces her to be his mistress. The ending is very sad.Through it all Tess maintains her dignity and is a very likeable character. This novel shows the extreme cruelty of legalistic morality that is not tempered by compassion and respect for others, particularly women during this time period.The book is very well written if you like poetic descriptions and vivid imagery. Hardy is a master of both, and of the human drama."
2260.5."A classic frustration... Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result. While not a ground breaking novel, it's eloquence and true to life appeal allows it to become part of you. I can only highly recommed this book and will read it again and again..."
2261.4."Best book forced to read...... Out of all the book I was forced to read...I LOVED this one... the movie was good but the book was great...it is the only book I still have from my early Michigan college years."
2262.1."Buyer Beware This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore."
2263.1."The worst book I have read I don't know how can this book be a classic. I haven't thought that I could find such absurd stuff in a book. Don't waste your time with it."
2264.1."WHY??????????????????????????????????????????????????? WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text? It is enough to put anyone off English Lit for LIFE. If anyone in authority is reading this, PLEASE take this piece of junk OFF the sylabus...PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!"
2265.2."couldn't give it more stars I haven't been able to get into it ...read only a bit and it hasn't held my attention...maybe I'll try again sometime... I know it is supposed to be like a classic so try it ...."
2266.2."""Poor Tess"" Thia is the saddest story I have ever read! Poor girl---she doesn't have a chance with finding a happy life! The cards are all stacked against her from the git-go!"
2267.2."Couldnt get to the story I thought the story line sounded interesting so i bought it...twice! Trying to get a version of the book that wasnt so diffucult to read, its ok off and on, half the time i dont know what the author is referring to cause it was written so long ago that the author uses that language and it just got in my way of the story, which is why i bought it again thinking the 2nd book looked easier to read but it wasnt...sadly i will be reduced to trying to find the movie to find out what happens and it bothers me because i hate to not finish a book!"
2268.4."looking back I have read several Thomas Hardy novels starting with The Mayor of Casterbridge many years ago in high school and I never really appreciated the style and the fact that like other Hardy novels Tess is a love story and a very good story. Worth reading"
2269.3."Typical Victorian: quite skimmable If you must choose between ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles"" and ""Far from the Madding Crowd,"" choose the latter. ""Tess"" is a well-written novel, and has quite a few exellent scenes--the most striking of which I consider to be the field scene where Tess incessantly labours (no rhyme intended!), only to pause devotedly to nurse her illegitimate son. Tess herself is a dynamic character; but the novel as a whole becomes dreary and calls for skimming."
2270.3."It's a classic but hard to read I enjoyed the story but it was very hard to read and follow at times. The British tone is very strong and takes awhile to get used to."
2271.4.can't wait to finish reading it Good book still reading it still trying to understand all the different wording of the book but it's pretty good I want you to review everything hopefully
2272.3."Suffering needlessly Difficult read but captivatingSimpleton pure high ideal. Poverty makes mockery of high moral in all. Live as it were unfair to women"
2273.4."Good book This is a good book. It is sad that many of Tess bad decisions caused her life to be worst off than it should have been. Instead of making lemonade from her lemons in life life she continued to suck on the sour sour fruit over and over again."
2274.3."sad story I am finding Thomas Hardy a great writer that I dislike. I plan on reading everything he wrote because his stories are very interesting and complex. However, I do not like most of his endings as the tend to involed the deaths of major characters in his works. In this story Tess has a very hard and sad life, that ends with her being hang for murder. All through the story I kept hoping that at some point she would find happiness or at least peace with herself. instead her situation kept getting more and more complacted and depressing. No matter what she did fate was out to deny her any hope of a nice fulfilling life. Finally she accepts death and escapes her suffering. Gloomy book but well worth reading."
2275.5."A classic that isn't boring or dull, actually fun to read!!! This was a very chilling and creepy book to read, I highly enjoyed it and recommended it. It came as such a great surprise that this book, written decades ago, is comparabely as scary as Stephen King novels, but more wicked (and rather a bit more difficult of a task to read).Through circumstances and the evil of others, the young just prior nymph Tess Durverfield, suffers a series of tragedies. A victim of innocence, youth, beauty, and love. THIS WAS GREAT!"
2276.5."Mechanical Female Tess is a very difficult book and I would not recommend it to the average old contemporary reader. There is so much more meaning behind the birth of the rapist's child, and the break-up of Tess and her ""husband"" Angel. You have to read the fine-lines and ""footnotes"". In other words, there is absolutely no way you could relate to this book, and anyways...why would you want to relate to books? The experiences Tess goes throught at such an early age has scarred her for life. Well, she doesn't live much of a life now that you think about it."
2277.5."MOST WORTHY CLASSIC NOVEL As the synoposis says: Violated by one man, forsaken by another, Tess Durbeyfield is a magnificent and spirited heroine of Thomas Hardy's immortal work.Written in a no-nonsense yet frilly female tone, Tess of the Durbervilles is just as comarible to ADAM BEDE, both are beloved and my most honored classics every. I enthusiastically recommend the two, these are the books that deserve to be called CLASSICS."
2278.5."Alec or Angel? False Morality Exposed through one Woman's Innocence ""I became acquainted with Thomas Hardy through another of his classic works, which lent to my curiosity on this one when the audio version was made available to me. It was an experience, to the say the least, hearing how the innocent life of this girl of late 19th century England played out. For no reason other than her own naiveté is she rendered with injustice and prejudicial attitudes of the day - Hardy's denouncement of his own country's false morals. In my view, all males of our current day and age should find this impressive work required reading, and then determine whether they are an Alec D'urberville or an Angel Clare. It seems we all fall into one category or the other."""
2279.4."Great classic Great read, had very few mistakes. The tragedy and triumph in this story has always attracted me, in a way that few stories have been able to do.It will always be on my favorite read list. Tess is the epitome of being a woman born in a time when circumstances really called for strength and courage. Now on my kindle fire and will go with me everywhere."
2280.5."Excellent I put this book on my ipod and then thought I'd like to be able to read it when I couldn't listen. I have a kindle and kindle fire. It went to both Kindles! Yea! Now I have the book all places so how ever I want to read it I can!! Amazon makes it all happen like magic."
2281.4."Great! Loving the book. Was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner! I can not wait to funish the book. Great price too. Thank you!"
2282.4."Tess of the D'Ubervilles A very good story once you get used to the old English language. Learned a lot about life in Victorian England and the double standard for men and women. Glad I read it."
2283.3."Insightful in parts, ridiculously contrived in others I had been meaning to read Tess for years and finally did this past week. I was mainly disappointed. The book starts off well...but it seems that 2/3 or so of the way through, the author became rushed....and the story becomes so slapdash and contrived I could not believe in the situations and definitely could no longer believe in the characters.The second quarter of this book, when Tess is at the dairy farm, is the strongest part. Hardy slows down; we believe in the characters and most of the emotions, and there is some wisdom and beautiful writing to be found here.After this point, it is, sadly, all downhill... I kept throwing up my hands in disgust."
2284.1."WARNING - Don't read the Introduction first! My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."
2285.2."so boring..... the story itself is original(using a common character instead of some nobility), but the story just keeps drugging on forever or something. It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them? So,do not even try to read this book if you have no time."
2286.1."I hated this book then.... ...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there, that's done."
2287.1."Sexist and unsatisfying See subject line. I would never recommend this book, depth and nuance aside. It was at no point pleasant to read. I struggled to finish it."
2288.4."Hard to read The way this book is written makes it hard to read. I only bought it because Anna talks about it so much in Fifty Shades of Grey."
2289.3."The book is just okay for a classic... Was it me or could I just not muster up sympathy for Tess? I just wasn't drawn into her character. Thus, I wasn't completely into the novel."
2290.5."One of the best Victorian literature ever... Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"
2291.2."Tess the Depressed! I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the ""heroine"" she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then. The whole book depressed me and I would rather not read another book of Hardy's again."
2292.5."I recommend this I thoroughly enjoyed Tess, even though it left me raging and gnashing my teeth at times. No picture of Victorian life can be complete without reading this book first."
2293.2."Disappointing This poor character never catches a break, and the writer makes you care for her, deeply. Emotionally draining and depressing"
2294.3."Nice photos and diagrams The book is well done and the instructions seem clear. It was a bit thinner than I expected for the cost."
2295.2."incorrect sewing instructions There are so many T shirt quilt books out now and my friend happened to choose one that has incorrect sewing instructions. Her quilt would have been easier to make with another book. I have several T shirt quilt books that are very good with instructions."
2296.2."PHOTO SHOWN WAS NOT ITEM SHIPPED. THE FISKARS SOFTOUCH SCISSORS THAT WERE SHOWN ON THE WEBSITE WERE NOT THE ITEMS THAT WERE SHIPPED. I WAS SHIPPED THE 'NEWER' VERSION OF THE SAME ITEM. I WANTED THE VERSION THAT WAS SHOWN AND EXPECTED IT. I DO NOT LIKE THE HANDLES OF THE 'NEWER' VERSION AND WANTED THE OLDER ONES, AS I WAS LOOKING AT ON THE SITE. UPDATING YOUR SITES WOULD SAVE EVERYONE MORE TIME AND EFFORT!"
2297.4."Swagman Bike Carrier Works well for the most part. The only problem we had with this product is that the bolt that is used to either keep the rack up or to hold it in the down position is weak. We used the bike rack twice and the pin is bent to the point that we need to replace it with a stronger bolt. Other than that we would have no problems recommending this product to anyone else. In fact we would buy this unit again."
2298.5."Great product Great product, works as advertised. It might be a bit to heavy for me (a woman) to manage alone but I'm not sure light product would be as sturdy and secure.We are able to fit out 4 bikes on it all right. Despite some reviews saying you can't put a kids bike on it - well, we hauled our little one's 14-incher with training wheels together with three bigger bikes, no problems. No additional bars for our bikes, no safety issues, recommend."
2299.4."Perfect for cruisers! One of the few bike racks that I found that could fit cruiser wide tires and 4 bikes. Price was good compared to competition. Only complaints are it's heavy and if you have a lift back you can't open it with the bikes on the rack."
2300.5."Big & heavy but great We have four bikes in our family and needed stronger rack to carry them. This is perfect for four bikes. It takes a little practice to figure out which bike goes on in which order. It is pretty easy to adjust as necessary. It is very heavy and therefore a little difficult to take on and off, but a little assistance is all you need. The locking pin does not ""lock"" in it only screws in, so for security you may need to purchase a locking pin with a key. Do not try to use this without a 2"" hitch, it is so heavy it wobbles and does not look very secure on the back of the car. The clamps that lock the bike hold them in place and do not allow them to move but they do mark up the bikes. I just use a small washcloth to protect the bike frame. For the price, this is a great rack."
2301.5."Perfect!!! I did alot of research before I made my purchase. For a 4-bike rack, this was the best price and quality. It is a little hard to put together because the instructions are not very detailed at all. Took my husband about 45 minutes to put it together. It is a little heavy but it is extremely sturdy. I wouldnt trust a cheap wobbly rack for my bikes. I read reviews that said it was too complicating so I was nervous when I decided to purchase despite those reviews, but other than the assembly,it is not complicating at all. It fits all types of bikes with no problem. It is perfect and I love it!!"
2302.5."Light and easy to use The Swagman XTC-4 Cross-Country Hitch Mount Rack is lighter than other bike racks and is easy to attach to vehicle. The attachments are easy to move and adjust to each bike that is put on it. Will be enjoying using this product for a long time. Seems to be very durable."
2303.5."Solid Rack A little heavy, but a good solid rack. Its great for any size bike or tires! No problems what so ever! I'd recommend it to anyone but the weak!!!"
2304.5."OUTSTANDING! The View From the Hill was one of the most exciting books I have read in a long time. It's a touching almost love story, an with exciting battle over Sterling Castle. This is a great book for not only the historical accuracy, but also for the story behind the action. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
2305.5."Best Disposable Nipples I love these nipples. I've ordered so many of these because my son will only use this nipple. We have tried the Medela nipples and every other type imagineable that will fit on our Medela bottles, but this is the only one he would use. It's a slow flow which is perfect for him. We will be buying more before we head to Cancun so we can use with the Similac Ready to Feed bottles."
2306.4."Great Quality @ Affordable Price We used similar type of nipples in the hospital when our baby was born and wanted to have the same with us when we travel from one place to another as being disposable they come pretty handy. Would recommend these not for daily use but when you are traveling. Its good that we found them on Amazon :)"
2307.2."Ummm I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me..."
2308.4."An in-depth look on Japanese school system and youth culture The author, Feiler, took up a year long tenture in a Japanese secondary school to teach English. As such, most of the chapters in this book are concentrated on comparisons between the Japanese school system and its American counter part. The author did an excellent analysis on this subject matter, there were lots of insightful ideas within the chapters. The writing style of this book is crisp and clear, sparkled with touches of humors at various places. Overall, it's an excellent book to be used for cross-cultural research, as well as a fun and educational book to read about. The only slight complain I have regarding this book is that since the author had concentrated heavily on the subject matter of 'schools', therefore he had to left many of the other fanscinating aspects of the Japanese culture unmentioned. It's not an all-around cross-cultural book."
2309.1."A waste of paper. This book is one of many written during the ""Bubble Era"" by ""gaijin"" (primarily Americans) who really knew next to nothing about Japan, yet somehow found a publisher, usually Japanese. Another of this quickie genre published about the same time was a book for teaching profanity to Japanese studying English.""Learning to Bow"" may by an accurate account of the author's experience living in Japan and teaching in the JET program. However, that's all it is. It's full of cliches, sweeping generalizations, and offers no insight into living in Japan or understanding the culture. What could the writer possibly know after only two years?"
2310.4."It's realistic, funny and has perspective This book is very good. Having lived in Japan for a year and a half, I knew some of the realities of school life. This book de-mythologizes the educational system and shows you not only its impressive strengths, but also its fatal flaws. I thought it had a very balanced approach. It would be great to read whenever you feel that the American educational system is being left in the dust. It will raise your spirits."
2311.1."Upsetting I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating."
2312.5."A Great Read About Japan! I remember before I left for my first trip to Japan in 1996, reading about Feiler and his adventures in an Onsen hot springs. I remember his description of having to take of all his clothes and bathe in front of all these Japanese guys he just met. Any yet, during my trip in 1996 the same thing happened to me! I felt just like Feiler! The book is informative about Japanese culture and at the same time a great read. Its a must read if you plan to visit Japan...especially if you are a teacher."
2313.2."It would be misleading to say this is typical of a JET Programme experience There is no one experience that could somehow describe them all. I didn't find the book very interesting, nor would I recommend it as reading for those who are going to go on the JET Programme sometime in the future. In fact, I recommend you read very little of the 'foreigner does Japan' genre and stick with facts, figures and Japanese language. And basics of English language teaching. Believe me, you will enjoy your 1-3 years in isolation and miscommunication without your head full of pop-anthropological nonsense and you will come to know your full self."
2314.4."A rare look from the bottom. An unusual view of Japanese society. Seen not as usual through the eyes of a tourist, journalist, or other professional observer, but from the viewpoint of someone living there. Mr Fieler must not only learn a new job, but a new culture."
2315.5."Best Book This is the best book I have read by or about foreigners living in Japan. The author has moved to Japan to teach English in a typical small town school. Quite a wide variety of situations and scenes in Japanese daily life are covered from an outsider's perspective. His interactions with the school's principal, district administrators, teachers, the students and their parents are well written in a descriptive and anecdotal way. Mr Feiler is not just a good storyteller but is a very insightful writer as well. I immediately reread the book and enjoyed the second reading even more than the first."
2316.5."A book on Japanese culture... This book by Bruce Feiler is not just about the Japanese educational system but about the Japanese themselves. While it does touch on how students and teachers work together, teen suicide and cram school, it also deals with the problems of racism, the way the Japanese balance their lives and their duties to society, and even a few chapters on Japanese dating and marriage. It is full of humor, insight and clear thinking. Mr. Feiler clearly but a lot of thought into his visit and is just as clear in explaining to us what he feels is the important and major issues that Japan has to deal with - not just then but now and in the future. A must for any library on Asia or Japan."
2317.1."Sarcasm and fabrications I was very disappointed in this book. I have lived in Japan for 6 years (and still do), married and taught on the JET Programme. As a former JET I was disheartened as this book does not paint an accurate picture of life in Japan as a JET. Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies. Also the frequent use of sarcasm and satire is not in anyway humorous and portrays the author as ""god's gift to English teaching"". For anyone curious about life on the JET Programme, teaching English in Japan or life in Japan in general, I do not recommend this book."
2318.3."A good writer Like many people in Japan this book was recommended to me but I didn't want to read it. A friend gave me a copy and eventually I read it.The author gets so many things wrong about Japan that I wonder if he really spoke as much Japanese as he suggests. I often found my self scoffing at his opinions and explanations. It seems this was the end of his Japanese experience as he has gone on to write books on other topics.He also strikes me as quite a loner, if this is the summary of his social interaction he must have had a lonely time, which on the JET Programme is not uncommon.However he has a very good writing style which makes up for a lot of his failures. I'd suggest reading it and enjoying his perspective but be wary of his explanations."
2319.3."Interesting at least This book is well-written and flows very well. However, some of the events in the book and the way that they are described are too ""black and white"" for my tastes. A good read, but if you are considering teaching or living in Japan, take this book with a grain of salt."
2320.5."Classic When I heard they were making a file of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, I thought, ""good luck!"". The main gist of the book is philosophical, a hard quality to translate on film. But Kaufman does it here, with the help of Daniel Day-Lewis - and manages to improve upon the book, adding color, humor, and a profound sense if intimacy. A touching and beautifully done love story."
2321.4."A beautiful and intimate epic I have not seen this DVD (not released yet) but this is one of my all time favorite films. Philip Kaufman (who also directed ""The Right Stuff"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (remake), and ""Henry and June"") combines beautiful and erotic visuals with a compelling story of people caught up in the 1968 uprising in Czechoslavakia, and its aftermath.Wonderful performances by Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, and Daniel Day-Lewis.Stands up well to repeated viewings. I have seen this in the theatre, on LaserDisc, and on the excellent Criterion DVD. Don't watch it full screen (4x3)!!"
2322.4."beautiful This film, is one of the best screenplays I have ever seen (and I seen many). I had read the book before, and the film is just an extension of the beautiful superiority of the book.I particulary enjoyed the mixture of 'real' footage of the occupation of Praque and the film footage. Very well done.The reason I've only given this film 4 stars is because it didn't have a specific secene which I was looking forward to seeing.But the reast of the film definatly makes up for it.And by the way... the director is the director of Quills."
2323.5."An investigation into the nature of relationships Why do we commit to one another? Do we really know? Would a life of independence and detachment be better? Both analytical and powerfully moving, this movie deals with these questions. At first seeming light and slightly intellectual, the movie evolves into something more felt than thought. The film shows what is going on without telling the viewer in words. This is a story about the nature of love in all its human forms. It is a heavy story that stays with you. Not for those not in touch with their inner self or who object to some tasteful nudity."
2324.1."Highly overrated It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up. How about some more nipples? Throw a pie in Juliet Binoche's face? Anything! Just stop wandering around, muttering to yourself like a half-wit.Perhaps I don't get it, but I don't get syphillis either and I'm the better for it. Where's your witty rejoinder to that?!A real test of patience, this film."
2325.1."the ubearable pain to watch This movie is the lamest peice of pseudo-intellectual crap I have ever seen. It is painfully self-serious and a major bore. This is porn for those who would never confess that they watch porn. If you want to see a good movie about human relations, go get ""Besieged"" by Bertolucci."
2326.2."Take off your cloth This movie is about nothing but nudity and sex scenes! In the first hour or so there is hardly any dialogue... just a nude scene after another. The only main dailogue is ""Take off your cloth."" And personally I don't consider this as a dialogue either.I didn't see the love story in this movie... no honest expressions. Just a man who lives a play boy life. I found this movie very boring and I even had to forward many of the sex scenes that I couldn't stand any further!Maybe if this movie had a dialogue, it would have made sense! Maybe if it was shorter! Maybe if there was less sex scenese! Maybe if there was a better (senseful) ending..!"
2327.1."Is This A Movie? I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)"
2328.1."Please read Kundera's book instead Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."""
2329.5."Timeless This film is by far one of the best ever produced: It`s erotic, humoures, sad, poetic and the protagonists are all interesting. Now, this is why many Europeans critizise American films.... They feel most productions from the US are stereotyped, all glam and over the top, while the European productions tend to move more straightforward into our human soul.... This film is one of those glorious occasions when film is high art and linked to the freespirited human soul."
2330.3."Highly bearable. I'd seen and heard of this film for twenty years. Finally checked it out from the library.Truth be known it wasn't near as sex-filled as I expected it to be. Sure there was sex, and a good deal of nudity, but not much more than many films. It was more of a drama heavy with sex, than a sex film heavy on drama. I quite liked it though it did run a good 30 minutes longer than it needed to. The acting was very good, as one has come to expect from Daniel Day-Lewis. Didn't know much of Lena Olin before, but what a beauty.I can understand the complaints of this being overlong and boring, but those with some patience and taste should enjoy it."
2331.1."One Great Big Sleeper I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye."
2332.1."Either you get or you don't..I didn't. This is written by a 43 year old male who is a true film fanatic. I love all the great directors- Spielberg, Hitchcock, Wilder, Kubrick, Landis, Scorsese, etc. etc.""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" was one, if not the most tedious films, I have ever had to endure. Why is it so talked about is beyond me unless, there is nothing definable to discuss. The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.It's the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a ""must see/ will change your life"" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times). Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time."
2333.1."Lacking The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology."
2334.5."Unique: Abstracting to connect I've seen nothing like it. The supreme and rich acting of Binoche and the abstract cinematography and direction manage to distance the viewers in such a way from the everyday noise of a thousand feelings, enabling the viewers to taste and sense all the emotion and ideas of the characters and the era with a vividness only accesible in dreams."
2335.2."Kundera was right to object The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society."
2336.3."You have to be in the right mood for it. I was a tad distracted when I started the movie and at no time during the first hour did it grab my attention. I felt like I had to force myself to watch it. Nothing wrong with the acting, but the story line isn't really that catching."
2337.3."Interesting, but not my favorite movie I supose movie critics would love this movie. I wanted to watch it because I am trying to see all of Daniel Day-Lewis' movies. It was okay, but I wouldn't watch it again. I wouldn't say it was one of Daniel's best, but his acting as always was great. Lots and lots of female nudity and some real looking sex scenes. Lena Olin was great, I think she is a very good actress and a beautiful woman."
2338.5."The best film nobody saw The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with."
2339.5."A literate, moving film I served in the Peace Corps in E. Europe in the early 1990s; this movie conforms to my experience of Prague, the Czech people, and E. European literature so completely as to take my breath away. Creating a full movie out of the first 26 pages of Milan Kundera's original novel is scriptwriting brilliance. The film's breadth and depth of each character, the larger-than-life issues played out against the seeming frivolity of the Prague Spring--and its tragic historic aftermath--never fail to impress me. This film has a very European sentiment regarding sexuality/sensuality, however; it is as woven into the fabric of daily life as a glass of fine wine. If you prefer more staid fare, I'd recommend many excellent British films."
2340.3."cuts, cuts and more cuts I like this movie very much. However I got really upset when I realized some ninkompoup has cut it in an absolutely unbelieveable way. It is claimed it is not rated, but displays an ""R"" and a bit smaller a ""PG"" and a ""DP"" rating. it stinks. I like comlete movies and I believe if anybody does any cutting it must be mentioned very clearly.I suggest if you like the original don't buy this version"
2341.3."It's okay I heard this from a teenager who wants to know everything about the world.After I saw this movie, I hated the doctor character. The depiction about love is very shallow. Plus, I don't understand the transition he made."
2342.3."A Bit Too Long This film, for me, moved at a snail's pace. It was described by Roger Ebert as ""The Most Erotic Serious Film since Last Tango In Paris."" Obviously the term ""erotic"" is subjective. I found nothing erotic about this movie. It would have been a good work had it been cut in half."
2343.2."A wispy shadow of Kundera's book... Making my comparison to Milan Kundera's book, I have to rate this movie fairly low. I don't believe Kaufman was able to capture the essence of Kundera's writing with this film representation. So much of Kundera's writing is internal to the characters, which is difficult (at best) to communicate on screen. Unfortunately, this is the richest part of the experience; I recommend the book, but found the movie decidedly unsatisfying."
2344.2."The Unbearable Lightness of Being Boring This is well acted, beautifully filmed...and pretentious exitentialist tripe. There's a difference between TRYING to be deep and serious, and being deep and serious. This movie doesn't know the difference. Long and slow."
2345.1."So If I'm A Jerk Do I Get To Live In Perpetuity, Too? Okay, folks. Let's get real. This movie/book is essentially about the insipid sexuality of three spoiled brats with soulful eyes, zero body fat, and no moral compasses. Worst of all, there's no search for the compasses. Why is this exhibition of unbridled existential selfishness so popular? Because the protagonists are European-and ""misunderstood"" quasi-intellectuals to boot. Translation: culturally paranoid Yanks just eat this kind of lean cuisine right up. If you're the type who likes being hungry 15 minutes after eating, don't miss this movie or ""The Sheltering Sky,"" mind-numbing fare featuring filthy rich American ""seekers"" ransacking the blistering desert (or desert tray) for spiritual bargains that won't make them too heavy with self knowledge."
2346.2."The Unbearable Length of Worker & Parasite (End Spoiler) Basically, it goes like this, Eastern European intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex. At the end, of what seems frigging hours and hours of self-loathing, when they finally find happiness, they all die in a truck accident."
2347.2."Extremely Let Down While a big Hendrix fan, as well as a fan of bluegrass - I was NOT impressed with this album. While the ""bluegrass"" was acceptable, it was a big stretch to extract the ""hendrix"" from what I was hearing. If you want a good Hendrix tribute album, try ""Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix"" (1993). You want a good bluegrass album? Try Seldom Scene.Overall, a nice concept gone terribly awry."
2348.2."What a stink I used this cutting board in my sewing class and loved it. No odor at all from the one in class.I got my mat and it smelled as though I had hit a skunk. My husband made me put it on the back porch. Then I learned that a friend of mine had one for 8 months and hers still stinks. Her husband won't let her use it inside. I went online and read that others had found the same odor problem from these Olfa mats. Some said that the smell diminished after a few weeks but others said it has never stopped stinking.I e-mailed the Olfa distributor to ask if the company has other suggestions. I may just have to send it back.Great cutting mat if you don't mind a strong toxic smell."
2349.5."This product saved my marriage! Just kidding. It's no fruit juicer, but it made my wife happy and works well. Nice size for an apartment and when combined with a rotary cutter, my wife found that cutting fabric was a delight as opposed to working with scissors, or the katana/stump combination I bought her for the job before I bit the bullet and bought her this mat. Once you get one, you'll wonder how you ever survived without this...and you'll keep your katanas sharp and ready for impending samurai attack. Or zombies."
2350.4."music's loss When E T A Hoffmann redirected his output from music to literature the world gained a lot. Not only did his literature have great impact with other writers, but his stories became the source of much musical inspiration (Wagner, Offenbach, Tchiakovsky, Hindemith, Schumann, Busoni, Delibes .....). But listening to this CD made me realise the world lost a lot as well, because Hoffmann was a very talented composer. I had previously heard some of Hoffmann's chamber music, such as the piano trio and harp quintet on this CD, and viewed them as pleasant but not memorable. The duettini italiani on this disc are for me, a pointer to greater riches in Hoffmann's music than I had previously seen.Other recommendations:Hoffmann's short stories, and his novel 'The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr'E. T. A. Hoffmann: Arlequin Ballet; Overtures, CPO CD"
2351.5."A fabulous LITTLE kitchen -- Love it We purchased this for our daughter for her first birthday. She loves it & plays with it constantly. It is great quality and fun colors & also comes with great accessories. It is very small (perfect for her size), but note this if you are buying it for an older toddler."
2352.4."Amazing wooden oven and stovetop, great price Another fantastic deal from Amazon. My son ADORES this little oven. It looks beautiful and comes with a complete collection of food, plates, pots, and utensils. The colors are lovely and it looks a great deal more expensive than it was. My only complaint is that the shelves are not solid in the wood backing. The small plastic bolt comes loose easily. It so far seems to create no structural issues, but it does make the yellow sliding door fall out sometimes. Probably could be resolved easily by adding a real screw to the backing. It is also on the small side (my two year old sits down to play with it), so know what you are getting before purchasing."
2353.1."Repeated book material & out of place reviews Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)"
2354.2."Man Kzin IX After a long hiatus from the Man-Kzin wars, I purchased the Man-Kzin Wars IX. The stories in M-K Wars IX were average at best. Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors."
2355.3."Shaeffer at war? Some of the stories were kind of weak, but then this odd crashlander guyshows up. Finding out what happens to Beowulf Shaeffer post the Crashlanderbook made the book completly worthwhile. If you're not a Beowulf Shaeffer fan, you might not enjoy it as much."
2356.5."Very Fast for Size! I now own 3 of them 512, 1G, 2G, write to it is 6MB/sec read is about 13MB/sec for it size the best you will find. I use it with RoboForm and BART-PE Boot OS, so it stays pluged in for long periods at a time and its size and round back make it the safest USB to leave in a laptop as you use it and move around and won't get knocked out or damage your USB port due to torque. I hope they never discontinue this model. A must have for the moble person on the move.Phil"
2357.5."Simple solution that works great! We installed these on the switches for the exhaust fans in our two bathrooms and the closet light in our daughter's room. They work great. They don't need batteries -- the low-tech spring does the job. They save energy because you can't leave for the day and leave the fan going all day long."
2358.5."Fits in my switch boxes... Our home was built in 2003 and this fits just fine in the outlet/switch box. It does exactly what it's supposed to. We set it for 10 minutes after we're done and it shuts the exhaust fan off in our bathroom.Saves money on heat and cooling..."
2359.3."OK product It works as advertised but- The spring generates quite noisy clicks when it unwind- There is no way to turn it off after it is set, you have to wait for the preset time to elapse. It could waste more energy in some situation"
2360.1."For Simple Minds I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives. I felt the book was shallow and was perfect for people who couldn't think for themselves. Any human being with half a brain can see through the empty content of this book."
2361.5."excellent book An amazing book. Personal life stories that all of us can relate to. Attempts to answer the question""why me?"" that we tend to ask in adverse times.Inspirational and uplifting."
2362.3."Great brand of mints I love this brand but the orange isn't my favorite flavor. I thought I'd give it a try but I wasn't in love."
2363.2."The official company biography -- dated, aging, but interesting. This is the only official history of the giant utility that serves most of northern and central California. Written in 1950, when the company (and its official biographer) were heedless of the changes that the future held in store for the energy industry overall (and utilities in particular) as well as for the end of unbridled growth and development in the state of California. Coleman is a real booster for PG&E. If you want the PR line, from the generation that build the company between 1930 and the 1950, this is the reference book you want."

2365.2."old music Music from the 30's and very nostalgic. My father played with this band when he was still in college in 1934."
2366.3."Swingin Japanese garage rock! The 5.6.7.8.'s is a good band. The singer has a very good voice, I think that's why I like this album. I've heard them better, this album has some tunes a bit too much proffesional, maybe.For me, the old 5.6.7.8's is the real thing. Their style of 1955 rock is very funny listen to.But they have some very good music at this album, I would by it again."
2367.5."Awesome images. I love this book. Honestly, I haven't read it. I've only stared at the images and drawn the dragons from the book. I LOVE drawing them.Perhaps I should read it some time too!"
2368.4."AN EXCELLENT GIFT BOOK Part adventure part encyclopaedia,The Dragon Chronicles is an exciting and unusual book. It will be enjoyed as much for its narrative thrills as for richness of its illustrative detail.The book appears to be a reproduction of an old journal that turned up for auction in a London sale room. It purports to be the diary journal of an old wizard, who to comply with the wishes of his dying king, sets off to find a group of malevolent dragons who are threatening the stability of the land.The book looks and feels like something that has been lying in a vault, forgoten for centuries. The pages are like old vellum and there are dozens of brilliant coloured paintings and sketches of dragons, weapons and specimens, like dragon eggs that were supposedly produced by various artist who accompanied the wizard on his journey. There is even a dried pressed speciment of a dreaded ""Dragnette"" a kind of flying piranha!Thoroughly enjoyable yarn for any age (why should kids have all the fun)"
2369.4."The definitive book for dragon seekers Really captures the imagination. An exciting yarn, incredible colour illustrations plus interesting specimens of dragon remains etc.A real collectors item, whether its a reproduction of a genuine document (as claimed) or not???Some of the imagery certainly looks believable."
2370.2."Proceed with caution This book is a continuation of Shore Lights, and follows the same characters as they now prepare for the wedding of Maddy DiFalco and Aiden O'Malley. I'm not sure why this book was necessary, because it didn't further the relationship, didn't end with the wedding, and was filled with family squabbles and bickering. I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline. Actually, the story was quite dependant upon Kelly and her life to propel the action. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's a family drama with no romance. No romance, no sincere story, and a lot of drivel."
2371.2."You can't be sure what you're getting I ordered the samples of this product because I was interested in trying the sulphate free shampoo, which is expensive. The samples are REALLY random, so you may not get ones you actually wanted to try. Most of the ones I got were things I wasn't interested in. And I didn't get the shampoo sample. They say you can return it for a refund, less shipping and handling, but the shipping and handling were double the cost of the product itself."
2372.5."For use in the Foreign Language Curriculum Excellent book for staff development within the Foreign Language department. Includes tools for evaluating both student and instructor performance with guidance on how to improve those scores."
2373.5."ISS Research Creatine. Good Product I HAVE SEEN ENERGY AT THE GYM, EVEN WHEN I RAN. NOT SURE IF IT'S FROM THE CREATINE BUT I KNOW ISS RESEARCH MAKES GOOD STUFF BECAUSE FIRST TIME I USE THE GLUTAMINE THAT STUFF WORKED REALLY GOOD.THEY'RE NOT FLASHY ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT; DON'T ADD CRAZY FLAVORS AND WHAT NOT, BUT THEY DO MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS. EVERYONE'S BODY IS DIFFERENT SO EXPERIMENT WHICH WORKS FOR YOU."
2374.4."Pretty Good Pretty good book. The author really did a lot of research with the people who were personally involved with the accident. She also did a good job by not writing the book as a lengthend NTSB report but rather the whole process the FAA, Coast Guard, and NTSB have in place to react to a downed airplane. She gave a lot of background information also and sometimes even too much. I really didn't get why she would write about the Mayflower or the history of the Coast Guard but it was her book to write, not mine."
2375.2."A worthless book I read this book and concluded that I am angry at myself for having read it. Pilots like to read about accidents hoping to study a case and avoid the same mistakes. After wasting your time with worthless and mediocre family stories and the well known government incompetence, you end up with the empty conclusion that a good pilot, in good health, all current and confident ditched in the stormy ocean at night and disappeared. None of the worthless stories or ILS text in this book provides any conclusion or lesson to be learned. A line from Billy Madison comes to mind: ""you are now all dumber after hearing this story"". In fact the only intelligent thought comes from an opinion of a reader that raises the theory that Ron S. used a GPS approach rather than ILS and that proved fatal."
2376.3."Not the best album, but still very good It is hard to judge this album after hearing Hawaii. ""Bach Ze"" and ""Green Coaster"" are seriously worth the album. This album also features some nice vocals from fellow Stereolab members also. I wouldn't suggest this album if you are just getting into them, but if you like the sound they do on a lot of their albums, then this is a worthy purchase."
2377.5."EXPERIENCE A NEW AGE. Shutters come down, safety inside, exile at home, this is more than just the best CD in the world.... This is the beginning of a new music age."
2378.5."Extremely rare type of pleasant ""art"" music from these ages. I first heard a track on the tv while I was doing something else. In a program reviewing new music. I was astonished. It didn't sound at all as all the other worthless types of modern pop. The first parallell I made was to the ""old"" 10cc. But of course, anyone who knows about Beach Boys, Brian Wilson and the ""Pet Sounds"" album would rather like to refer to those. I will go and buy at least two of the albums."
2379.5."Correction in my previous review It's actually ""Hoops Hooley"" that sounds straight off the Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds"" album. I love this stuff. Get it!"
2380.4."im moving to cookie bay stereolab and sean o hagan might as well be the same groop...a lovely companion piece to that cobra thing. more subtle then cold and bouncy, plus help from the lab girls. this is a solid album, great melodies and the wacky sounds youve come to expect from the whole incestuous chicago scene."
2381.4."SNOWBUG IZ COLD INDEED!!!!!! Well I loved Cobra & Phases....by Stereolab!!! I loved Cold & Bouncy the previous effort by the High Llamas!! And Snowbug takes right off where the last album left off and exceeds!!!!! Phew!!! Our favorite gyrls Laetitia & Mary lend vocals on 3 of the tracks and they sound so beautiful... Fianlly Sean gets funky and this album proves it...Maybe it has sumthin' to do with the help of Jim O'Rouke and John McIntyre... This album is remarkable...I recommend it to all!!!!"
2382.5."Less cold...more bouncy Wow! With ""Snowbug"", a return trip to ""Hawaii"", Sean O'Hagan and friends have created their most accessible CD yet. While retaining the Wilsonesque arrangements for the most part, the vocal aspects of the production have been honed to a more refined level, thanks in part to the inclusion of more female background vocals. Gone are the avant-garde electronic-bloop excursions of ""Cold and Bouncy"". The new direction on this CD is the incorporation of Brazilian influences into the already exotic High Llamas cocktail. These developments in the band's sound gives ""Snowbug"" a warmer overall feel than any of their previous efforts. I don't see how any critics could argue the true excellence of this collection of songs, though many have pointed to the Llamas too-strong Beach Boys influence in the past. It is unassailable in it's musical genius, a beautiful work of art."
2383.3."Read if you want to hear the stories others won't tell you. Of course, the reason others won't tell you those stories may be because the stories are patently false. I was looking for a book that would be a good read after ""Collapse"" -- something that would tell me about fallen civilizations. This isn't that book -- at least not from a rigorous, scientific approach. The author, for example, asserts that pterodactyls live in today's Arizona.The author believes that traditional academics are dismissing the truth because it doesn't fit in with their preconceived notions. The only reason I didn't rate this book lower is that it is clearly a great source for others who feel the same way. The rest of us, however, need to look elsewhere for scientifically grounded speculation into North American prehistory."
2384.1."Boring I bought this book thinking that I would learn something or at least be given food for thought. What I got is a bad travelogue full of inane information about restaurants where the author ate, people he met, what he wore. There is nothing there for a serious or even amateur scholar. Just junk."
2385.5."The book that initiated my addiction to beat As a Californian, frequenter of the Sierra Nevadas, as well as a college student who obsesses over fine American Literature, I found this work to be perhaps the most well written piece of beat fiction i've read. Contrary to popular belief, I feel this is a much more mature and insightful piece than ""On the Road"" (not to take anything from the brilliance of Kerouac's breakthrough work) and should be held in reverence by literature and philosophy enthusiasts across the globe. Japhy Ryder's Buddha representation, as well as Kerouac's struggle to incorporate his new discovery of traditional buddhism with his original Catholic upbringing are representative of the Western Frontier of Eastern Thought, which is becoming more popular even today, thanks to the likes of Jack Kerouac. Bravo!"
2386.4."My favorite Kerouac Although this isn't the greatest book written by Kerouac, it is easily my favorite he has written. There are many weak moments and contradictions by the characters (Kerouac) but the passion in the pages is hard to deny. He really means everything he writes and believes he is trying to become a better person. All told, it is a fun, romantic trip; this is something that is lacking in today's cynicism."
2387.4."All is Nothing Anyone who has any respect for nature, the Dharma, life, or philosophy will gain from this book. Kerouac always has a way of drawing a reader in and putting you in his place. It's a beautiful and eye-opening book."
2388.3."outdoors but not impressed jack kerouac came recommended by several presumably legitimate sources however, after reading the dharma bums i may have to think twice the next time these people offer up others. while i myself am an avid hiker and can relate to the sections in this book dealing with such senarios the book as a whole seemed to drag. there were some scenes which had much potential to be captivating such as when a friend's girlfriend committs suicide, but kerouac fails to really emphasize. overall i rate this book 3 stars because of the subject/genre of book that it is but i have read much better authors. not impressed."
2389.2."Well... I've read ""On The Road"" three times over the last six years. It is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Having said that I decided to get ""Dharma Bums"" and I did not care for most of the book as I am not into Buddha and zen. Only once in a while a glimmer of the fun of ""On The Road"" seeped in, but not enough.I also did not like the supporting characters as I did in ""On The Road.""This book was pushed by many people as Kerouac's second best. I found it to be uninteresting and probably should not pursue any other of his books if this was considered ""his second best."""
2390.3."Nothing like On the Road The plot is about Ray Smith a thirty-something (I presume), unemployed, hippie who is on the road hopping trains to find his inner Buddha. Eventually, he winds up in California and meets up with Japhy Ryder who he imitates to a T, letting you know full-well that Ray Smith has no mind of his own. They meet other Buddhists, drink wine, talk about Buddhist stuff like the Diamond Sutra, Bhoddisatvas and Bhikkhus, past Buddhas, and they write a lot of haiku poems. All the while, the narrator is constantly bombarding the reader with his strange Buddhist revelations he comes to while praying like ""everything is empty but awake"", or ""rocks are space and space is illusion"". It gets old fast.Ray Smith reminds me of a less-cool Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"".You won't find any fascinating stories that Sal Paradise (""On the Road"") had of meeting new people wherever he went, jazz clubs and drinking too much, the drugs, the sexual encounters of the women he entertained... nothing."
2391.3."Bums but not Dharma If you are interested in Beat literature, American lit, the 50s or the American experience in general, by all means read this book. You'll learn a little about all of the above and be entertained by a talented, exciting writer. If you're interested in Buddhism, please read something by an authentic Buddhist teacher (i.e. the Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh, etc.). Jack Kerouac's own life and the lifestyle presented in this book have little connection to the practice of Buddhism."
2392.5."Favorite Liked this more than On the Road. Has a completely different feel. One of my favorite reads."
2393.3."""Easy Rider"" meets ""Bar Fly"", meets ""Into the Wild"".... A somewhat sad story...The protagonist, a dis-spirited, wistful, melancholy soul, who's ""haddit"" with middleclass, American society (who hasn't) and - with constant refills of his huge, bottomless wine goblet - hits the Highroad, full of Zen, Buddha, etc...I was just waiting for this guys liver to simply explode from his body...Reminded me a bit of ""Catcher in the Rye"" (odd), ""Into the Wild"", ""Easy Rider"" and, in a more odd way, Hongo's ""Volcano""...This theme of restlessness, discontent, (self?) dissatisfaction...And never quite finding a Home. Never - even with the aid of horrific amounts of booze - not quite Settling In. I wonder about Kerouac's State of Being - minus the alcohol... Sad, not triumphant, story."
2394.5."VIVA RUCKSACK REVOLUCION! Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks. Dharma Bums gives you a glimpse into the life of the Beats with a focus on their cut of Zen. This really is a great story and it will inspire you. On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better."
2395.3."Important book, but ultimately rambling and pointless. This is an incoherent book by the self-absorbed author/voice of beat. Ironically, in attempting to die to self the beatnik ultimately implodes into isolation. How ego-driven can one be but to ignore reality in the name of embracing it? You cannot separate the spritual thin ice in which Kerouc lives from his novels."
2396.2."On the Road Again. Ok. Let's talk like ordinary people. If you are someone who has to buy a new TV unless you have one, only because the TV is more modern this is your book. If you've read ""ON THE ROAD"", maybe you'll want read something diferent. This is the same book, the same drama, the same wasted money. Can this book change your life?? Yes, but also a stone at high speed could do it also and in less time. Ally McBeal or a Backstreet boys song have more message than this book."
2397.2."Don't bother I tried to give Kerouac a chance to revive himself after reading his most notable mess 'On the Road.' Now I'm thoroughly confused as to why he's so popular."
2398.2."Kerouac is not that great Maybe I am not as enlightened as all of you, but I don't think this book is all that great. Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing."
2399.2."Failed to be powerful...or even interesting One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes. (Is a person a real Buddhist if he is proud of his Buddhism?)What was a powerful and introspective journey for Kerouac, is not for the reader. I can tell that it's there, but Kerouac just doesn't get it all the way across. I found myself rolling my eyes, but still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.If this will be your first Kerouac read, as it was for me, choose something else or it may forever turn you off to Kerouac, who could be an otherwise fabulous story-teller.If he is, let me know."
2400.1."Shallow I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better."
2401.2."One show about nothing is enough OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac."
2402.2."Bummer Not much dharma going on here. But lots of bum. In fact, I'm totally bummed out finishing this novel because now I feel very uncool to not be enamoured with this bible of the beat generation but I, just, don't, get, it. So much rambling! Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing. Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it."
2403.3."Reading The Novel Seems Better Can't say that this really grabs me like On The Road did. I feel less like in on the action and comings and goings of the people mentioned in the novel. Admittedly this may have to do with the fact that I actually read On The Road before I purchased the audio book and I only read part of The Dharma Bums, before getting the audio book. The person who narrates the audio book seems bored and listless."
2404.4."It's Kerouac... Stylistically and idealogically its Kerouac through and through. The idea of living a truly free life and one without boundaries truely provoked a lot of thought for me personally. It makes you want to be one of Ray and Japhy's friends; to go find a shack to live in and really exist in what may be the only best way to exist, free of material incarceration. I recommend this book to be read by young adults everywhere. Not all will be opened to a new way of thought and what really matters in this world but some will and it could possibly change their life for the better by not being wrapped around society's focus on material possession as symbols of achievement."
2405.5."kerouac's best This is the book that lured me into the world of kerouac. I had previously read ""On the Road,"" which was excellent, but I feel no match for ""the Dharma Bums."" This book changed my life. It changed the way that i thought. Kerouac introduces the reader to his experiences and beliefs through his novels; they are mostly semi-autobiographical. Before this novel consumed me, i had no notion of Buddhism. In retrospect this has been the single most influential thing that I have been exposed to. This book is just a starting point for a Kerouac fan. I recommend that you follow this book with Kerouac's ""Desolation Angels."" Simple, and yet so satisfying literature. I have not really encountered any other writers who are so beloved, so beautiful and poetic in few and simple jazz talk and random amusing European literary name dropping. Pick this one up, maybe it will change your life too!"
2406.5."Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it! Yes, ""On The Road"" gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. ""Dharma Bums"" soars as high as ""Big Sur"" dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors."
2407.3."A better travel companion than On The Road Dharma Bums is On The Road realized. As is most of Karouac's books, D.B. is about longing for the search. It actualy has little to do with Zen and the such but represents a thought common to all souls. Beautiful nievity and un-understood wisdom. For anyone on a path of couriosity and truth. For more on Zen try looking up Robert Pirsig."
2408.2."Sometimes it works At first this printer worked well, but after a year it is nothing but trouble.To begin with, you can't print more than 4-5 pages before the ""page grabber"" will start to grab more than one sheet of paper at a time, and the text ends up going across both of them.Then there is the printer driver, which is also not up to par -- where is the manual two sided printing that has been in the classic Mac OS for all of these years?In short, this was my last HP printer. The jamming paper feed is too much for me to handle."
2409.1."Great book, but not this Kindle edition There's no question on the importance of Hodge's book. But this $3 Kindle edition is simply scanned with OCR and is almost worthless. It would have been far easier to read it in simple image form."
2410.2."Poor Kindle edition My negative comments have nothing to do with the content as Hodge wrote it, which is excellent. But the quality of the Kindle edition is very poor. The OCR scan has resulted in unintelligible words in almost every paragraph, and the lack of links in the table of contents severely limits the usefulness as a reference source. It's not completely useless; in general I can find what I'm looking for and make sense out of the text. So for 99 cents I suppose I'm getting my money's worth. But an edition of better quality would be most welcome."
2411.3."Skip the Kindle version The Kindle version available here is a horrible OCR failure of epic proportions. The text is very badly garbled, with a great deal of work needed to read through it. The actual book, however, is brilliant, and highly recommended!"
2412.1."horrid e-text This kindle version is not worth the money, even if very cheap. It is a poor uncorrected ocr scan. It is unreadable and unusable. Find a cleaner edition. This is a rip-off."
2413.5."Five Rule! Five are definetly the world's greatest boy band. Even though they split up, they are still awesome.""Let's Dance"" is a very poppy song, and definetly makes me want to dance as the title suggests. The extra track ""Sometimes"" is awesome and the remix is pretty good. The Megamix rules and overall ""Let's Dance"" is a good single to buy.I recommend it to any people who like dance music, pop music or anything catchy. Also, if you're a huge Five fan, this is a must to buy. A definete 5 star."
2414.4.epic movie this movie is amazing on HD the story is awesome the battles are intense and its just a nonstop thrill of a movie the only 2 minor thing thats bad is megan foxx wasent in this one what can i say im a fan and 2 they are 0 special features but to me that dosent matter as long as it was well made on bluray and it did i defently recommend this movie go out and buy it ASAP and enjoy
2415.2."Plot? What Plot? The usual action scenes, but ridiculous plot holes. The vast majority of the plot points made no sense whatsoever, I think Michael Bay is trying to make the worst possible movie that still makes millions of dollars."
2416.2."not worth it mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies."
2417.2."Just Not Worthwhile I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit. There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one."
2418.3."Completing the Collection I bought this to keep my collection of Transformer movies intact. I found the setup for the plot a little slow going. I rate this as the third in the series should be rated. The fantasy is a little too fantastical. The action not quite up to snuff. The new girlfriend has the eye candy on her side, but the mystique is missing. The returning characters did their part in upholding the imagination of the film. I did not see this in the theater, thank goodness. It is worth watching again but not one for the ages."
2419.1."WAIT!! As you have read, wait for the deluxe version later in the year. So for now, just rent it for now!!!"
2420.1."Wait for Special Edition I made the mistake of buying this version. But luckily I didn't open it once I got home, so I was able to return it today. I'm not going to fall for the same money trap again(Avatar). I'll just wait a few months and get the Special Edition one with all the extra features.Now me just ranting here for a bit. But what the hell Paramount, I know times are tough for everyone but do you have to do this to us. Trying to rip off the loyal customers is not good business."
2421.4."Awesome This movie is great. Fun for the whole family. Is action packed and we don't get bored with this one. Recommend to go ahead and buy this one."
2422.3."This is not a movie review This is not a movie review. If you are reading this by now you have already decided whether or not you like this movie. I am here to write about the product. In short, I liked the movie but, I didn't like this product. All that it provides is the move in three different formats; Blu-ray, DVD and download. The weakness is that that's it. No extras, no deleted scenes, making-ofs, or interviews just the movie. The movie looks good in 1080p which does it good service but, at the end I felt a little jipped when I find out that's all I got. At $20 you get what you paid for but, if you are waiting for the full home viewing experience I'd hold off on this buy and wait for the full set."
2423.1."DIRECTOR's PERSONAL SIGNATURE ......??????????? UPON leaving my 9 year old insised to know EXCATLY what was happening in the bathroom stall?SPOUSE was blank .... I hummed and hawwed .....IS THAT SEQUENCE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED?"
2424.1."you pay less at the theater Its just thye movie with no special features.I made the mistake of buying it. Had i known i would have never bought it. Avoid wait till the special features come out."
2425.1."If you're 16+ don't bother These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you."
2426.2.crappy acting i was really looking forward to the new movie i was so mad when i found out that megan fox got booted i knew that it would be hard to replace her not cuz shes beautiful but storyline wiseman they really messed things up in this one its sooo diff story wise than other towfirst off i hate the girl in it yeah shes hot but she doesnt fit in megan was a poor hot girl didnt mind getting dirty or fighting this girl is spoiled rich girl afraid to break a nail type and theres no background really to there love so were suppose to believe hes so head over heals he wants to marry her?also her acting really sucked and so did sha laboufs i thought he was on speed the whole movie talked way to fast and way overly drmaticthe beginging to middle of the movie was lame they tried way to hard to make it funny when what made transformers so great the first two times was that it was almost like unentional jokeshowvere the middle to end of the movie was excellent
2427.3."Movie only Although I didn't purchase this movie through Amazon, I thought I'd enjoy having this Blu-ray combo pack. The movie is fun. Better in my opinion than I would have thought. The action is fast and the CG has come a long way in the short time between the first and third movies.My one complaint is that although, you get a combo pack with the DVD and a digital copy, you get no extra features. If I had known that, I'd have waited to purchase it at later date. I thought it was insulting to include a coupon for the 3D copy of the movie in the package itself.Will I purchase the next version with all the extras? No.Buyers who don't care for any extra features will be happy with this version. The transfer to Blu-ray is very good. Surround sound works great on a home theater system.The story is really only an excuse for the action. Don't think about it because there is very little plot. It's a fun popcorn movie but missing vital information for those interested in any of the background information."
2428.1."no speacial features This is a good movie. Just stay away from this version. I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film. I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant."
2429.2."Bogus - no special features - rent it, don't buy. (SORRY...THIS IS FOR BLU-RAY, NOT AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO) Would have given 4 stars for the movie/blu-ray, but I was very disappointed there were no special features at all - not even notes. That's the main reason I like DVDs and blu-rays so much...for the special features that may contain commentary, interviews, behind the scenes and show how some of the FX were done - explosions and such. I'm sure they will release another version in the near future with the special features movie buffs enjoy and spend more cash$ Who the hell comes out with a new release Blu-ray in this day & age with ZERO special features??? DO NOT BUY - RENT FROM RED BOX."
2430.1."DONT BUYYYYYYYYYY!!! Dont give money to these filmakers that later on down the road release a better version of the same movie..If you want extra features this version WILL NOT have it on the disc!! Wait for the deluxe version!"
2431.1."Not even rental worthy Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow."
2432.1."Love 3D hate the Price. who is on crack that they think any movie is worth 42 dollars 3D or not. This is just another scam like with cell companies and internet providers charging for data like there is some limited amount that isnt self imposed. The technology is not so overwhelming in RD to cost 4 times that of dvd and twice that of blu ray.Dont get me wrong love 3D and this was one of the best 3D movies I have seen but honestly 42 dollars just is taking advantage of consumers in a market that has no where else to go. If this disk was 30 bucks Id by it hesitantly but thats the problem with blu ray they charge way to much for the theatre experience. Sad too cause this movie and captain america are ones i would have bought but i refuse to let them think this is a good going price for the gimmick."
2433.5."Probably the best movie of the year I don't understand why people didn't like Revenge of the Fallen. I thought that was great. I thought that the first Transformers the best... Until I saw Dark of the Moon. Dark of the Moon was just a perfect movie. It had comedy, suspense, and (Most importantly) action. Some of these action sequences were just great. And there were some white knuckling sequences that you HAVE to be prepared for. And Shia LaBoef was just great with the new actress. She was better than Megan Fox. In more than one way if you know what I mean =) But altogether, this was an A+ in my book. So dissapointed that it's the final one. Michael Bay, this was your MASTERPIECE!"
2434.1."sucks i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie"
2435.1."Not really a good movie This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth."
2436.2."kind of a pathetic dvd I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one"
2437.2."I feel as if I got scammed by Paramount Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)"
2438.4."Great third movie This is a great third movie for the series. Not to happy with the dropping of Meagan Fox from the series, however this movie gave the general population more of what was wanted...giant robots fighting. There was a perfect mix of disappointment, sadness, and then again joy in this movie. There were also a lot of parts that just left me stunned...in a good way. Disappointed with the way they had to throw one f-bomb into the movie. Great movie, lots of fighting, and an acceptable conclusion to the series, for now."
2439.4."Good but not the best I love all three of the Transformers movies, but this last one is not my favorite. Whatever the reason for Megan Fox not being in Dark of the Moon, there is a loss of continuity with a new female lead. There was chemistry between Megan and Shia LaBeouf that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley doesn't bring to the screen, IMO.I do appreciate the irony in the government getting outwitted by the Transformers again! What would happen, if there's a Transformers IV, if they actually get cooperation at the outset instead of having some stumbling, bumbling upper echelon idiot get in their way? I know it's in the script, and it gives good drama... but it's the same story line over and over.In the end, however, it's (spoiler alert) the good guys' triumph over evil, the requisite stunts, explosions and stomach churning, death defying drama that makes this movie *almost* as good as the first two. Definitely worth having, and thanks, as always, to Amazon for the availability of prepurchase!!"
2440.3."War flick with robots - not even as cool as it sounds that's all it is. but long & drawn out. no fun. main redeeming part was some good actors happened to be in it, which in no way gives value to this movie. so if you just want to watch robots fight, this is your movie."
2441.2."Uggh, such a waste of potential! I really liked the first one, and the second one was okay too. But Dark of the Moon was difficult to sit through for me. Endless dialogue with minimal action sequences, I found myself looking at the time far too often. They dropped Meghan Fox, who despite her controversial reputation, definitely added to the cast. The special effects are still amazing, but there just wasn't enough action. BORING!!! If they are going to continue with this franchise they had better turn it up a few notches."
2442.5."Transformers Excellent sequel and follow-up to the first movie. I think I still like the first one better but, either way I definitely enjoyed it. ;-)"
2443.4."Loved It! I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!"
2444.5."I love this series! I like the new love interest in this movie a lot. Also this is a great extension of the last two movies. i can't wait for a 4th to come out."
2445.5.Good I was very satisfied the product and the speed I received it I would do business with them again, I was very satisfied
2446.1."AVOID at all costs!!! If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."
2447.1."Digital copy is expired Digital copy expired 2 months ago so unable to put it on ipad. Would not have bought if i knew the digital copy wasnt included"
2448.1."Even Amazon Prime can't Save Optimus Prime this time Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this movie was. At least I didn't pay to see it and was able to read a software tech manual while ""watching"" this. The plot is thinner than the paper it was written on and the acting, well its typical Michael Bay which means you can see more believable productions at you local high school. It was easily an hour too long and the special effect have been used hundreds before. I think the saddest part was hearing Lenard Nimoy as Optimus Sentimental, I mean Sentinel. Gratuitous sci-fi pandering at it's lowest."
2449.1."Be careful when searching for ""3-D movies"" I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones! I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections. Ouch. All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future. My bad."
2450.1."Awful movie. Standard Michael Bay garbage. Totally removed from the original idea, especially concerning Optimus Prime's character. The ideals the character originally stood for are completely ignored in favor of kill shots and 'Murican tough guy crap."
2451.1."waste of time continuity was not there, story line was unknown. so unrealistic, non continuous, special effect show that even that was no good."
2452.2."Enough already Two of these movies was plenty. The hot girl was so ridiculously hot as to be unbelievable and not in a good way."
2453.2."Unremarkable, but not as bad as the previous installment I don't even remember the plot, the resolution, or much else about this. However, I also don't remember it being painfully bad as the previous installment was. You should not go out of your way to watch this, but there are worse movies."
2454.1."WAAAY TOO MUCH CG! I got dizzy watching the machines transform. I only watched the movie to see Chicago, because I live there. Needless to say, I did not like this movie."
2455.3."Not Great but not horrible I didn't see it in theatres - just when it came out on blu-ray. The story is about what you would expect of a Transformers movie and of course lots of CGI. The main complaint I have is the girl that replaced Megan Fox. I'm not a fan of Megan Fox, but this new girl was just awful as an actor and the character was equally as bad. At least with Megan Fox's character and acting you could believe that she would thrive in those perilous situations (and without running around in super high heels and always bright white clothes the whole time.)Other than that one complaint, I would say the rest of it was on par with what you would expect from this type of summer blockbuster!"
2456.1."Bleh It takes more than special effects to make a movie. The first film was good, the 2nd one mostly decent, but this was unadulterated, predictable, garbage, full of bad acting eye candy. The heroine of this tale couldn't find a coherent sentence with a conjunctive map. Should have stuck with Megan Fox. At least she had some real attitude."
2457.3."3D was Meh... Read so many reviews about how funderful the 3DBR was and had to make a purchase. Ran home like Charlie from Willy Wonka with the golden ticket. Ploppled in the disc and after having seen the menu, just knew it had been a good buy. After having watched it at least 3 times on a 51'inch 3D tele (not bragging, just want to give folks an idea of what the movie was shown on) must say that it was ""just okay."" Yes there are 3D scenes but nothing more than watching a 2D conversion of Sleepy Hollow w/JDepp DVD. There weren't any wow moments. Overall IMO it was ""just okay."" Watched Titanic 3D several times this week and to me, is what 3D should be. of course your entertainment value my vary..."
2458.1."1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd)."
2459.2."A waste of special effects . . . and a complete waste of electricity. Michael Bay has not been hungry for years, therein lies the problem. Let's see what happens in the inevitable sequel."
2460.1."Kiddie Fodder... Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague."
2461.4."Good Sci-Fantasy Action Movie This is a good action packed movie sure to please the science fiction/fantasy enthusiast. The story starts with an alternate history of the moon landing with an alien discovery twist and moves on to become a fast-paced action movie with the familiar heroes except for one, a new romantic interest. The new romantic interest, played by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, fails to measure up to the previous one played by Megan Fox.The sound and video are both first rate and will rattle your rafters if you crank up the sound high enough. The story line holds ones interest and provides enough surprise elements to keep one guessing. This is a worthy addition to the franchise and a keeper for any collector of this genre.I recommend it highly."
2462.5."More than made up for Revenge of the Fallen!!! DOTM made it easy to forget 2009's ROTF. The ""plot"" was much improved, possibly because there was only ONE writer this time. Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen were in this movie. A great way to end the series, as well. If they made any more, I would hope it would be the military and Autobots working together to hunt down Decepticons, similar to how ROTF started out.Please take my advice: how good a movie is has nothing to do with the studio wanting to get consumers to buy the movie twice. If you disagree, then spam the studio with correspondence rather than deduct stars from your review.Try it this way next time: ""DOTM was a fantastic action film, but I am disappointed the Blu-Ray release hardly has any extras. Otherwise, 5 STARS!!!!"""
2463.1."Movie is horrible... Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture."
2464.3."its OK If you're into special features, wait for the special edition to be released later.It's a good movie, dragged a little for me. Glad it's over with."
2465.1."epic fail very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed."
2466.5."loved it loved the movie more than the television series from the 80's.......my boys loved it so much they were characters from the movie for Halloween....my 3 year old loves cars more than ever after seeing this"
2467.5."Was a gift for my daughter She loved it when she opened it on her birthday. Now I want to watch it lol. It looks exciting."
2468.5."Watching it on my PS3... Great Quality! no problems at all playing it on my PS3. Not a fan of buying Collector's edition, price is great."
2469.5."luv it Must i say more it a f****in good movie me and the kids love it.. If you dont have it ur late"
2470.5."Awesome Action Movie!! This movie is a great movie for those of you seeking for action. It's simple, fun, and it's full of action. If you're into movies with a deep meaning, this isn't it for you, but for those of you that just love action like me, it'll be awesome! Blu-ray definitely makes this movie pop out and you'll love it if you have a huge awesome HDTV."
2471.1."Avoid.. Falsely advertised Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon."
2472.1."Dear Mr. Bay, Please stop ruining the Transformers franchise I love to see the Transformers in movies but I will never get the time back that I spent watching this movie. Good actors in a crap movie do not make a good movie. Fantastic special effects do not make a good movie. A well written story and characters that you care about make a good movie."
2473.1."Redefinition of LAME I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The ""stars"" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!"
2474.2."At least the special effects were fun The special effects (and the fact that I am from Chicago) were the only things about this movie that I liked. The story was dumb and the acting SUCKED!! I can only recommend this for someone who has absolutely nothing else to do and doesn't mind sacrificing a couple of hours."
2475.5.fabuloso mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando con ustedes
2476.1."Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP! This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie."
2477.1."instant video is mislabeling it's movies as 3d I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection."
2478.2."Boring Less of a plot than the first movies. Fell asleep twice watching it, despite all the explosions....Seems like the writers may be running out of ideas"
2479.3."There’s no dark side of the moon (matter of fact it’s all dark). I found this movie to be just ok, it a definite improvement from the second one, I’m glad they slowed down the transformations so I could see the change which is one of the reasons you watch the movie. I find the story line to be on the level for kids and the dialog should follow and not have so much adult content in it. That’s why kids today have no respect for anything, it what they imitate from movies (how unfortunate)."
2480.2."Try to see how long you have to watch before you realize this movie is a disaster... It only took me about 15 minutes. These Transformers movies keep getting more expensive and equally more ridiculous. The first one was charming and really funny, especially the first half. The humor reminded me of Armageddon. I actually liked Shia LaBeouf back then. This one tries way too hard in every aspect and fails in almost all of them. I understand these movies are not to be taken too seriously (I mean this is one step up from Power Rangers), but this movie could've been presented much better.The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the special effects and action sequences were exciting at times."
2481.3."Not exactly what I expected I should have asked my grandson for some instruction before I watched it. Moved too fast for me to keep up on what was going on."
2482.5."Great movie Like all the other Transformer movies just great, one you can play over and over and never get sick of seeing it."
2483.1."Transformers: Dark of the Moon This is a disappointing film. The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects. This one didn't really bother. Mind numbing, and in a bad way."
2484.1."Another 'video game' type of movie, Whyyy? Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!"
2485.2."Not more than meets the eye 20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. I was disappointed by this movie I am actually embarrassed I bought it last Friday when it came out. My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys. The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever. No character development, no real emotion and Transformers that in many scenes never even fought back. If you have to rent it skip the first 45 minutes, but don't buy it it's just not worth it."
2486.4."Great conclusion to the trilogy!! Okay, first off I just want to say that I absolutely loved the Dark of the Moon and honestly believe it was probably the best of the three movies. Special effects were spectacular on the blu-ray and everything just seemed so clear and unbelievable.The only problem I have is... special features? Or maybe, the lack thereof. I honestly have to admit that I didn't really look at the description to see about the special features because... it's a new movie!! I pretty much thought all new movies came with SOME kind of special features, deleted scenes, commentary, gag reel, SOMETHING!! But this didn't and it leads me to believe that they'll probably re-release all three together in a special 3-D, blu-ray pack with 'Never Before Seen Footage' etc... etc... Which is the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5. That, in a nut shell, irritates the peediddle outta me!! : )"
2487.2."Disappointing! Just got this Blu Ray and just found out there is no DTS sound unlike what the description says on Amazon. Wait for the better version!"
2488.1."Not 3D THis company advertised this as a 3D movie. When I received it it was only a Blu-ray. They told me I would have to ship it back to them to prove it. I was very upset and they are horribel to work with."
2489.2."Provincial There's so much to say about what's dumb about this movie, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. A great movie when you want to give your brain a rest. Best viewed on mute."
2490.2."I fell asleep. I know it sounds hard to believe, this movie being so loud and ""spectacular,"" but I was just so bored by the giant gizmos shooting at each other again, I fell asleep."
2491.3."Love the movie I didn't realize when I made the purchase that I would not be getting the jacket with the movie. It came in just a plastic disc cover. The movie works, but there is no resale value or collector value without the jacket."
2492.5."Love Transformers I really liked this movie. I own the first two on DVD and despite what a lot of people think of Michael Bay's movies, I took this for what it was: a fun movie bringing an iconic childhood toy to life. I grew up watching the cartoons and was really excited when I heard there were going to be live action movies. Now I did enjoy this movie more than the second one, not that I hated Revenge of the Fallen. I loved the action sequences and the special effects. I admit I watch them more for the actual Transformers than the human actors. I didn't care for Patrick Dempsey's character. I don't watch Grey's Anatomy so I have no attachment to him as an actor and I really didn't like Rosie Huntington-Whitley. Sorry, but she shouldn't quit her day job. Acting just isn't her thing. Other than that, I loved the movie. I'm waiting until the collector's edition is released later this year. I have to have my special features."
2493.1."Ugh! The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
2494.4."movie: fun, 2-disc blu-ray/combo: bad I must admit I thought the third film in the franchise was a lot of fun, most notably with the integration of the 3D photography. Here though is the problem: it becomes very apparent that Paramount/Dreamworks is so eager to release this, that they throw this version out to the masses, minus the expected extensive supplemental material - the word is that the deluxe (and 3D) version is coming out in November/December AND given the (highway robbery)price $31.49, Paramount/Dreamworks thinks that Joe-consumer is an utter twit and will buy anything Transformers related at the drop of the hat - well, I ain't buying this version, I'll wait for the 3D version.Oh and according to Paramount's press release the MSRP is 29.99 not 44.99 - Amazon is RIPPING US OFF - big time!!!!"
2495.1."Bad movie? You're soaking in it Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague."
2496.1."Ouch In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes."
2497.2."Bad marketing Like that lame Avatar release, no extras on this either. I saw it in a movie theater and this one is by far, the worst one of the three. And they want to milk it for what it's worth? How can you milk it, when it is a pretty bad movie? Stay away, unless you are a true die hard fan."
2498.3."No Special Features!! So disappointed - this version had no special features. Now I know I have to look a little harder to make sure there are special features."
2499.3."this movie is way too long and boring for 2 and half hours.... this female opposite the main characther is a no talent acctess who just stands there and looks pretty with her puffy lips which looks swolen the movie i wouldn't buy it if it were for free i have the first one which is ok. will not waste anymore dollars on these movies.what hapen to john voight? i gave it 3* for effort, some of the special affects are pretty intereting. should have been at least one hour and half."
2500.5."I enjoy these movies I've enjoyed all of these movies. Growing up with the Transformers I was very excited when the first one came out. This Blu-Ray looks great and the digital copy is great for when I travel."
2501.4."From Gods to Machines I received the message that the U. S. government is hiding knowledge about what is beyond Earth's atmosphere. But all governments hide information from the masses of their people. What intrigued me was when the Sentinel Prime character said to the Optimus Prime character that they used to be gods and now they were called machines. I can relate to that statement. I am a descendant of a people that were performing high sciences at one point in time and now we are beasts of burden. Try to talk to a typical African person about science and see what you get. At best they'll say, how does this help me pay my bills? At worse they'll look at you like you have 2 heads."
2502.2."Dosen't play well This DVD does not play well at all. I wish I would have purchased this elsewhere. The price for this should have been much less to equal the quality."
2503.3."Who knew Megan Fox would be the deal breaker. The special effects were excellent. The story was easy to follow and the writers did a wonderful job. As usual the talented Shia LeBeouf carried this movie and made it look effortless. Again. Was so glad to see the return of Tyrese and Josh as the fearless fighting forces. Looks like Michael B got the best out of all his actors....that is exept for the female lead. Never thought I'd say this but...I missed Megan Fox. What were the casting directors thinking? I'm going to buy the movie but I actually had to stop and think about it...not something I do if I really liked the film. If they make another Transformers here's a hint...if you have to beg Megan to come back? Do. It."
2504.1."Yes, but no cigar Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Make no mistakes, is a good movie if you like machines beating up humans without the humans being make into jelly.The opening was the best in the world. If they had only kept it that way... But no. It desintegrated into pieces. The FXs were fabulous, but you can't make a whole movie out of that.Sorry fans. I was disappointed, but then I'm not a kid anymore, so that's probably the reason."
2505.2."Great eye candy, but compares poorly to the first one No surprises left, and a highly predictable plot. But great action scenes and spectacular special effects. Tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode, but lacks the suspense and drama. My 8 years olds got a kick out of it. I got bored."
2506.3."tranformers dark of the moon not a good movie for under 18 years of age.i don't know why they have to put curse word in the movie when there other words they could have used"
2507.3."Transformers 3 Maybe I'm just not a Transformers person, but I found this one to be long, drawn out, and boring. The plot was rather ridiculous (as per usual) and I'm was extremely saddened by the absence of Megan Fox. I guess if you've seen the other two, you might as well see this one, but to me it wasn't all that enjoyable."
2508.1."Horrible Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did."
2509.2."Pre-Order Screw Up This review does not reflect anything about the movie. I pre-ordered this item Sept 22,2011 thinking I was going to get it as soon as it was released. Guess what? It's Oct 3rd and and I'm still waiting. Will update review as soon as get the movie. Update: Finally arrived 4:30pm Oct, 3rd."
2510.2."I saw this movie in 3-D I really don't think I would buy the blu ray dvd movie, but when I saw it at an IMAC theater in 3-D, it was increadable. That's the only way to see this movie. Without the 3-D effects, it's not that great."
2511.3."Who's the ugly blonde chick Pretty good movie liked it better than the second one ...however the Rosie chick was completely lame compared to Megan"
2512.5."Transformers This item worked as advertised and excellent customer service. I would do business again in the future with this vendor."
2513.5."More than meets the eye Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an excellent movie. The adaptation of the animated series into a cinematic format has been completed with great effect. The storyline is also imaginatively and creatively thought-out."
2514.4."Not bad, not the best I am a HUGE fan of the Transformers movies, but I have to say that this is not the best of the series. As much as I am not a Megan Fox fan, they should have kept her. I also thought that the ending was a bit abrupt. Not really the way I would have ended the series. (to my knowledge, it was the last)"
2515.3."Transformers live action movie 3 Third installment in the transformers live action series. Not as good as the first two with some pretty major plot issues but great action sequences and good special effects. Fans of the series should certainly see this but don't watch expecting a mind blowing plot."
2516.3."Transformers: Dark of the Moon This movie suffers the same imperfections as the review I did on The Three Musketeers. The movie is a fun movie to watch, watching it in 3D makes it even better. The quality of the movie is suspect, it has several flaws, there are scenes that fade out, and a couple black drop outs, it only last a couple seconds but takes away from the overall viewing of the movie itself, this is why I didn't give the 5 stars I think it deserves. Whatever company put this movie to disc need to check their master copy for flaws."
2517.4."great movie This is a great movie lots of action and intrege. Being the third movie in the series i was afraid it was gonna be a flop but it was a great movie after all."
2518.5."kicks ass this is a must-own bluray. looks killer and sounds incredible. definitely a great way to show off your system and the story resonates with our current economic and political problems when it feels like evil has already won."
2519.4.Action Movie Great Action Adventure with a really good plot and lots of great actors! It will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat!
2520.5."What can i say, its Transformer!!! Just wondering when they are coming out with the next movie hehe. Of the 3 in this trilogy, this is my son's favorite."
2521.1."Not a good movie at all...stinks!!! Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film."
2522.1."Nice show but wait for the 3D version Wait for Black Friday or the 3D version to be released,it gonna be like LOTR Bluray all over again.First version Theatrical version(normal length)Second Version Extended Cut"
2523.1."Same as Avatar - No 3D or special feets!!!!!!! Booooo! Booooo!Don't buy it because no special features are available but there will by by years end, so another clever studio scheme capitolizing on consumers! Yes, they probably factored per 1 million copies sold - 10 - 60 % will double dip generating a flow revenue for the impatient and believe me 90% of americans are IMPATIENT, so they know they have the rabbit by it's tail! Don't take the blue or red pill on this one!!! No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus...I hope this truly helps you out, seriously.."
2524.2."The joke's on me, I watched this crap! Coming from a diehard TF fan! I can't believe Hasbro alowed Micheal Bay to butcher this franchise on the big screen! Okay the first one was okay, the second one was pure imature garbage, and Dark of the Moon was meh.... I will say though there are some G1 nods, but not enough, for crying out loud they did a horrible job on Soundwave, and Shockwave, and why did they make Bumblebee such a crazy warrior, for goodness sakes in the G1 series he was a Recon Transformer, not a fighter, because he would always get he's butt kicked! And Starscream getting killed by Sam, really Bay? And of course the human are flat out stupid, crude, cartoonie, and just add to stupidity of the trilogy! And Megatron is crap in this, they make him look like a sad lost puppy in ROTF, and DOTM, and Alpha Trion (excuse me SENTINEL PRIME) was never on the Ark! And Alpha Trion was never a Prime! They should rename this trilogy, BayFormers!"
2525.2."Held my interest for minutes at a time Some really nice animation and some segments that held my interest for minutes at a time, but mostly disjointed and tiresome. The talented cast improves the quality of the film, but not a lot."
2526.2."A 2 star movie at best & what a dog I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo. Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it. Lastly hang on to your money you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket."
2527.2."More of the same The special effects are what you expect from the Transformers series, but the story line also is unfortunately what you expect. It's just more of the same disjumbled events getting thrown together. Some parts of the movie flow well, and others are just plain ridiculous. It's past time the writers & director for this series either move on or grow up and quit turning every scene into some kind of teenage behavioral prank. They've done the bumbling parents, the stuttering idiot Witwicky kid, the jive talking robots, and the goofball super secret ex-agent to death already. How about having grown adults who are fighting for the planet's survival actually act like it?"
2528.1."Don't buy this movie I am glad I watched someone else's movie before I spent money on this lousy thing. I will always be on my do not buy list. Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie. It would have been better without her all together. And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox. I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste. Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program. It would have been better as a cartoon. If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it. This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.Oh and I might give it a 2.5/10 but since this is on a 5 scale it only gets a 1 and I would have given the other 2 movies a 4/5."
2529.1."The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap. The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck."
2530.3."It's okay. I'm not a huge fan of the Transformer franchise but I was bored and it was free through Amazon Prime so I gave it a watch. It was an okay way to kill some time. I won't watch it again and it didn't make me a fan of the franchise but it did a decent job of killing a couple of hours."
2531.1."Not a good movie. Not for children. Not recommended for children and not even teenagers.Poor story.Nothing new or interesting.I was expecting something better.Dissapointed."
2532.1."garbage Man, I wanted to like this movie. I'm a big sci-fi fan. I do not think revenge of the fallen was as bad as people say it was, I even enjoyed the first transformers, but this. Oh-my-gosh. What a piece of garbage. I rate this down there with Avatar (the movie version of the nickelodeon cartoon, also a fan, huge let down).I am very forgiving of sci fi movies as I do not expect much in the way of plot/story line. I am a big fan of cool special effects, but this was so corny, cliche and chock full of redone and rewritten old jokes and plagarized scenes, that even I could not take this. I am becoming angry even now, while writing this.20$ for this piece of copro-cinematic excrement is $19.50 too much!!!!"
2533.1."No Special Features First, the movie has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. However, the real problem with this package is that the disc does not have any special features!"
2534.2."Far too long and too formulaic Oh please... this movie doesn't tell a story so much as show off special effects and replay platitudes. Should've left well-enough alnoe instead of making this far-too-long sequel."
2535.1."Terrible movie with good special effects The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones. If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy. Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time."
2536.3."Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray... The movie was good. the 3D graphics could be better. I would only recommend this movie if 3D graphics is not important."
2537.4."cannot play video on linux 64 bit because of amazon drm retardedness I cannot play this video on linux despite having a very fast computer with a very good nvidia graphics card. The video starts playing and then a retarded amazon notification pops up saying it can't play it because of my flash player and it is unfixable. Well if it started playing and then stopped due to a pop up that has to be DRM. Amazon you need to knock it off now.The movie is fine."
2538.1."Digital Copy Doesn't Work Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed. Nothing on the Amazon site indicates the expiration date. The package has this warning on both the outside and inside. Amazon offered a full refund. That's a stand up company in my opinion."
2539.3."Fairly Good The only problem is when you replace the original cast it loses it`s basis. Not to mention what happened to the original girl. She should have been in it or at least showed a breakup. Otherwise a great film. Can you imagine Spock or bones being replaced? How about all those robots on Lost In Space and Star Wars being replaced? Or the princess being substituted for a sleep around slut?"
2540.2."The worst of the trilogy! This was suppose to be such a great movie and it fell very short of all the expectations I had. I have been a huge fan of transformers since they came out in the early 80's. It's sad to think this could be the end of them on the big screen. I hope they redeem themselves by doing a 4th installment. Bring in Hot Rod and Ultra Magnus from the original series. I for one hope they don't end on such a poor film. I was very disappointed! As hard as that is to say. It was really bad."
2541.2."Want Megan Fox back!!!!!!! I liked and enjoyed the effects but that's about everything entertaining about this movie. The quality (blue ray on ps3) is pretty bad ass.Story line is very mediocre and no depth at all. The acting was sad at times.And most importantly I missed Megan Fox, someting just wasn't right with the new big upper lip girl. Maybe with Megan it would have been a better movie? Guess we will never know."
2542.2."Terrible movie.. They need to get a new director and new script writer.. They just keep getting worse and worse.. Get rid of the Witwicky's.. It was funny the 1st time,now everything is just drawn out.. I never saw it in the theater and just bought it on blu ray.. I'm regretting it.. I don't understand why they don't use the original voice for Megatron.. I won't watch another one.. They should add the Dinobots,and make Devastater like in the cartoons,5 robots merged into a giant one,not a cross between a cement mixer and garbage compactor.. Cmon,what a shame.. It could be so great if someone actually cared about it."
2543.1."garbage Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity."
2544.2."Lights out on this awful film I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as ""immature"" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection."
2545.3."Packaging Lies... It does not contain a digital copy, you must enter a code and download the copy. This is false advertisement, period. I have limited bandwidth to begin with, and now they want me to take 8 hours to download a copy for my portable use, as well as possibly have some folks get cap fees for data downloads. Plainly state digital download, not digital copy as others I have purchased include the digital copy on a seperate disc...easy as pie and copied to hard drive in 3 minutes or less.Overall the movie was okay, other reviews basically state it all. I saw it in 3D at the theater and again, it was okay."
2546.4."Transformers This item was suppose to contain a digital copy but it only has a Blu-ray and a DVD disk. The digital disk was not included, from the package and from your advertising it was suppose to be included. What happened?"
2547.3."better than expected Surprisingly good movie. I didn't expect it to be this good. I liked the special effects and the growth of the main character."
2548.1."not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes The DVD is not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes, then the picture becomes stopping and going and keeps that way."
2549.2."Fun cheesy movie but not on prime instant video!! Michael Bay movies are meant to be action packed fun cheesy goodness. Which this is. The reason I'm giving this a bad review is because Amazon Instant Prime has edited out parts!! It's a PG13 movie!!!!!! It doesn't need edits! Considering how much we pay a year for Prime, I expect to be able to watch the full movie."
2550.2."Just a bad movie Poorly acted, written and plotted. Sci-fi and action movies are my thing but I couldn't get through this one as it seemed like all involved just ""phoned it in"". Worst movie I've seen in a long time."
2551.1."I Am A Fool For Having Suffered Through This Dreck Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall story that makes a 1962 comic book look Shakespearean. Michael Bay you ruin everything you touch. And I'm worse for having seen this."
2552.3."Meh Eh, Shia Lebouf is a great actor...but everyone was just dumb in this movie. If I'm a hot, British actress... I don't think I should stand in the middle of giant alien robots shooting each other. If I am a small human man, I shouldn't venture into the heart of Chicago, where ALLLLL the alian badguys are, to JUST find my girlfriend(although she's fricken hot).IT felt rushed. Good movie, but Revenge of the Fallen is way better"
2553.4."Love this movie Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features."
2554.2."Ten Minutes of Action, Five Minutes of Drama, Two Hours and Twenty Minutes of Awkward Teenage Angst I won't say that this movie doesn't have its moments, just that they are few and far between. And you know those horrible, horrible memories everyone grows up with, the kind that scream ""embarrassment"" at high volume when, a few years later, you are reminded of the fact that yes, you were stupid enough to say that in front of those people? This movie is chocked full of those moments."
2555.2."Nothing special about the special affects Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage. Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay."
2556.2."Could have been MUCH better and shorter The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.Save your money if you intend to buy. Better rent and save the rest for a better movie."
2557.2."Can't believe I gave this 2 stars I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan I'll watch almost anything once. This is one of those one watch movies. A huge disappointment and not enjoyable at all. The first half of the movie is spent trying to make you lust after Huntington-Whiteley. She is so one dimensional that she's impossible to like, let alone think she's appealing. There was zero chemistry between Huntington-Whiteley and LaBeouf. They wasted half the film trying to show how LaBeouf could be the worst bumbler of all time and how everyone knew it. Somebody in the studio obviously doesn't understand the Sci-Fi audience."
2558.4."Great stuff from Micheal Bay A great smash em up movie (as usual for transformers) with michael bay directing proceedings. Hope they make T4 to end it all, I'M CERTAIN that there are still some decepticons to smote somewhere on earth."
2559.4."Good series ender This was good series ender, still in line with the other two and lot's of action. New girl, cuter than Megan possibly."
2560.4."Transformers 3D The movie was all we expected, and the 3d was just that much better. definitly worth the money. I was very pleased with my purchase."
2561.3."Not Like NEW. Rapid shipment but item was not LIKE NEW as advertised. It did not come in the original box, but in a cheap clear box. The disk had marks on it, not clean like new."
2562.1."Wort. Movie. Ever. Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me."
2563.1."no 3D version I`ll make it short and come to the point quickly: I think its a shame that Bay is starting milking the cow too by NOT putting the 3D version in this set. Pirates 4, Thor, Tron and so many others included a 3D version. I won`t buy this release and wait (let`s see for how long) for the 3D release. I know many of you hate 3D - I love it on my 65"" panasonic and was soooo looking forward for this. just my personal opinion..."
2564.3."Pure Entertainment I watch these movies (Transformers) for entertainment mainly. The acting is somewhat subpar. I did like that the parents made an appearance, they were very funny. I didn't really miss Megan Fox, but the new girl didn't add to much to the movie either. The action was very good as were the scenes, but I felt they could have shaved at least 30 minutes off the movie and still came out with the same results. I did think the beginning of the movie was more interesting than the end."
2565.2."This is actaully worse than Transformers 2? yep, I can honestly say it is. A boring Nasa storyline that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to begin with, sam gets a new girlfriend and is trying to find a job, along the way we still have annoying charectors such as the mom, the asian guy, some dumb momments with sam and his boss. movie is too long with no story, no charector development, with no action until the last 40 minutes and this is a 2 and half hour movie. If the robots had fought on the moon I think It would have been more interesting and a different location, instead we get a main villian robot that is not memorable, a repeat of the robots fighting and causing destruction in the city. special effects are amazing but it can't save how poorly written this movie is. its all visual with no substance."
2566.2."I Was fooled again After seeing Revenge of the Fallen,I thought this one would be way better,I thought they would have learned their lesson,but I was wrong.This movie is a 2 1/2 hour snoozefest.I paid 7.50 to see this,what was I thinking.Dont make the same mistake,just wait and rent it.Heres what you do.Rent it,get it home,Fastforward through the first half of the movie,also fastforward through all of the John Malkovich scenes.Then watch the second half,try to determine who the good bots and bad bots are,because theres so many its hard to distinguish.Shias new GF in this movie is super hot but thats not enough to save this movie,It will make hundreds at the box office because of Suckers like me."
2567.2."Quality The HD streaming always fails...The movie itself was fun to watch and very enjoyable. It would be nice if the streaming quality held up."
2568.1."Makes a great drinking game! Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess..."
2569.1."Fun movie, but not worth buying at this price--my bad! if you are like me and like to go through specials features and ""making of"" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. This is the second time I make the same mistake. The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else. It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature. Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release! The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie. I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom. As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake. I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY. What do you think? Any opinions?"
2570.2."Very Disappointing, No Special Features There are no special features included in this version, which is a big contributing factor why I buy movies in the first place. Very annoying that this bare bones version is being sold at full price. More annoying still is the special features will probably come in the 3D version, which I do not intend on buying."
2571.5."Optimus Prime have all of them now..was a good movie..only part that sucked was them replacing sam's girlfriend w/someone else..other than that it's filled w/lots of action and all those Autobots.."
2572.5."Brand New! I am so glad I got this Transformers Video for my younger brother he is going to love it and it is in brand new condition. Thank you for this great Christmas present at a great rate !"
2573.2."Good but disappointed I have seen four 3D movies on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. I was disappointed. I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective. They don't send things protruding out at you like other 3D movies do. It doesn't have the WOW-factor that other 3D movies have had."
2574.1."Terrible This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
2575.5.movie i love it cuz it was fast delivery and my son wanted this as a movie night to add with the other two he has and plus the movie was in good condition and i was ok with it not having a case cuz the case to me is collecting dust and when you have a disc you can add inthe dvd book sleeve
2576.2."Never thought I'd miss Megan Fox! I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching. I really couldn't stand Sam's new model girlfriend. She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily. I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar. Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon. Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building. There's foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they're going to be taking refuge in a glass building. What could possibly go wrong?"
2577.2."It's ok... Not much of a plot differance from the 2nd one... I saw them film in Chicago in 2010... That was the only cool thing about this movie, the Chicago back drop... Other then that don't buy this unless you saw it and liked it.. If you haven't seen it just rent it!!!!!"
2578.4."good I thought it was a good movie. I grew up watchig transformers. Its nice to see it brought to the big screen."
2579.4."Fast and Fun Adventure Sci-Fi with great FX features, a fast moving story that's only flaw was that the beautiful young lady from the first two movies was absent."
2580.5."Transformers: Dark of the Moon watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much"
2581.1."Yawn 30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me ""hero"", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie."
2582.1."cool robots bad acting sloppy story The Decepticons play the Autobots like a used violin and demostrate Cybertron's AI still has a long way to go. While LaBeouf and Turturro act as if this movie is their character's last episode --- and they really over-act in this movie which is lacks the charm of the original TV cartoon."
2583.2."horrible i want the 150 minutes of my life back. this is my first probably last movie review. this move was so bad it motivated me to take the time to do my fair share of trashing it a bit"
2584.2."Terrible plot, interesting effects. I'm a big fan of Transformers going back to the 1980s cartoons. This movie, like all the other recent ones, do a major disservice to the franchise. But at least it looks good while doing it."
2585.1."One of the Worst Works of Mankind If you've been wondering if our species is ascending or declining watch Transformers. If you haven't been wondering, I would like to take this opportunity to pose an ironic question, ""What is it like to be mindless?"""
2586.2."Wow this is bad! If your 10 years old, then perhaps this is one of your very ""bestest"" films ever.......but other than that, this is close to being un-watchable for the rest of us. I only viewed it because of Spielberg's direction, but even he couldn't save this pathetic, phony, ridiculous movie. Just not for any person that actually thinks......or even smarter than average cats, dogs or monkeys. Total waste of time."
2587.2."Very dissapointing for Blu-ray and 3D! This movie overall was disappointing. I so liked the first two that I really wanted this one in 3D. This was by far the worst 3D movie I have purchased. The flying paratroopers is the only reason to see this in 3D. This movie as like a very bad opera - it just went on and on and on and on ... so that when it did end you were so thankful it finally got to the inevitable conclusion."
2588.4."Annoying girlfriend character I am a fan so not going to repeat all the good things already said or you already know but I will comment on the girlfriend. She is annoying. I believe she is British. The accent and those lips ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FIT this All American movie. She is useless and I did learn to ignore her. No chemistry between her and anything in the movie. It just does not fit. They should have found some American girl that is tough, rough, and All American."
2589.4."Recieved two days after expected date Used an unknown carrier ""Ensenda"" - package was lost and then found. I could have purchased at Best Buy and got it quicker"
2590.5."Cant wait for Transformers 4 Absolutely awesome as usual. One of the best actions series of all time!! You cannot ask for anymore than what Michael Bay and company provide here."
2591.3."Better than I expected I loved Megan Fox in the first two, so I had set myself for disappointment. I also avoided watching it until now. It was much better than I expected. It held my attention the whole time, but with that much action it's hard not to. The dark side of the moon had everything you could want in a movie: comedy, action, desire, and teary-eyed moments. When the autobots said goodbye and walked into the shuttle, I felt tears prick my eyes - though I knew they would be back!I will say though, that as part of the transformers movies go, it wasn't my favorite. And other than characters, there wasn't much to tie it to the past movies. The things that happened had barely or not not even mentioned in previous movies, so this movie, could have very well just been a stand alone movie.With this being said I liked the movie and recommend it."
2592.2."Well no. Cheesy, rushed and too much Shia. Bay's twist on this is not liked by me and much better could have been done. But what do I know? The animated movie was excellent compared to this crap and even the games War for Cybertron and the Fall of Cybertron make this movie look bad. Action parts were ok."
2593.3."Transformers: Dark of the Moon Blu-ray 3D Blu-ray This movie has some good 3D effects. Doesn't make you jump out of your seat feeling at all, but has some cool dimensions. Watched it 1st on Blu-Ray, then 3D with Blu-Ray. Have to say 3D was better, just wish there had been more scenes where the 3D was captivating! Ok is my rating. Surround sound added some sensation at times, just not consistent. A good part of the movie can be viewed in 2D & never know there is any 3D..."
2594.2."Dark Day On The Moon I have always had a problem understanding how anything which causes the degree of destruction as does the transformers can be of any merit for the planet. Then there is Shia, he makes me want to hurl every time I see him in these roles. The last thing I liked him in was HOLES."
2595.3."Transformers DOTM Review An average sequel movie, worst than the first movie but much better than the second one.Pretty clear quality and great action. Too much focus on the humans, should feature more of the Transformers.Bluray is great but contains NO extra content whatsoever. Only contains the DVD and Digital Copy."
2596.4."Great movie but digital copy not for android Just adore this movie and bought it with the included digital copy so I could transfer it to my X oom. Unfortunately digital transfer is not possible for android devices so be aware of this."
2597.5."best movie made to date, and fast shipping Seen the movie at the theatre and knew then it was going to be a must buy on blu ray when released. Amazon always delivers promptly and on the release date."
2598.5."Great movie I bought this as a preorder from Amazon and you couldn't be the price for a 3 disc set! Movie is very good and if you like the other Transformers movies it's a must have."
2599.3."Ok printer for the price I bought this printer 3 years ago. It works great. The only problems are: the power cord has a short in it, the ink is pricy, not enough memory, freezes up, and sometimes will print lines or it will smear. I like HP printers and think I will stick with HP for a long time. I am going to up-grade to the HP laserjet 4050N or 1300N because of our home network. I think this model has some defects but in the newer printers HP has fixed them."
2600.2."Good prints... bad compatibility I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer."
2601.4."photograph printing If you are looking for a home photo-quality printer (not pro quality- but good enough form me), for a decent price. This is your printer.I can print 8X10's that come out with amazing results. I even use my scanner to print from the negatives and the photos print out better than my local store (I am not comparing to 1-hour development, I am comparing a local specialty store with an amazing reputation).Just make sure to use (and of course set the printer) to high quality photopaper, and you will see amazing results.I bought this printer a few years ago and have never had a problem with it. I don't know if the newer versions are better, but I can't say a bad word about this printer."
2602.1."bad usb connection on P1000 I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again..."
2603.4."Nice Large Basic Safety Pins ****These are your basic large safety pins and come in a package of 65. I always found myself buying assortments of safety pins and using up all of the large ones first, so these solve a problem for me. These safety pins are all the same size, called a ""Size 3"" as far as safety pin sizes go, but actually are two inches or 5.1 centimeters long. They are nickel-plated, not fancy, but do the job just fine. Save yourself a lot of time hunting these down in stores by buying them here on Amazon! They seem sharp enough for the uses I have for them; however, I don't think they would be good for any extra fine work, as they are just general-usage quality.Recommended.****"
2604.4."When you need a safety pin... We are organizing our costume stock and large quantity safety pins are in big demand. Wish this came in a larger quantity, but they do serve the purpose."
2605.1."Safety pins As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash"
2606.2."Cheap metal It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough. This rough point causes the material to cling to the safety pin rather than allow the pin to pass through easily.I would recommend the Dritz Quilter's Safety Pins. They are Nickel plated which makes them smooth and rust resistant."
2607.2."Maybe 2 1/2 stars. For Cena's first movie, it was okay. Lot's of explosives but I really wouldn't recommend the movie. Some okay jokes, and the story line was kind of weak. Typical ransom, give me back my wife type of movie. I recommend that you wait till the movie comes on television, and then decide if you want to buy it or not."
2608.3."Let's hear it for the Bad Guys!!! Okay I will admitt that I love BAD movies. Boy did I pick a doosy! Skip the plot, skip the hero, take a quick look at the wife in her bra, then cheer for the bad guys! The best acting and lines are with the baddies. I just loved their robbery and the lines there are great. Picture the bad guys running knee deep in mud in a swamp. Then the head bad guy stops to answer his cell phone. He then tells his partner on the other end that the deal is off. He then stops that conversation and answer his call waiting. Now he says,""Does that include the sports package and HBO?"" Don't get me started on ""rock candy"" and black guys and mini vans. I was truly soory when they bad dudes all died. Heck they would make a better movie than this one."
2609.5."get this movie i love this movie for the action and all the bad crimanals get what they deserve at the end.i recommend this movie 100/00 percent"
2610.3."WWE....why??? WWE really needs to stay with rasslin than making movies even though outside of The Rock, John Cena did ok."
2611.1."Even Robert Patrick couldn't save it I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark."
2612.4."Good for what it is . . . OK. First off, I don't see this movie winning any prizes for story, script, plot, or anything like that.That being said, I think it was a good action flick. It was well-casted, the fight scenes were well-choreographed, and the explosions were lots of fun. Also, I think it was a good start for Cena. Get the man some acting lessons and let him try something that doesn't involve as much running around and beating the heck out of people."
2613.4."B-Movie-Licious I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised, and a little disappointed in my own taste, but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions, Fighting...and that's it. Luckily, it delivers both of those in spades, especially the 'splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion, of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully. Plus, he's a hottie so...Overall, just an easy, cheesy, blow-em-up, action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame, though."
2614.2."The Few, The Proud, The Marines Oh boy, it seems we have a wannabe Rambo in the house! Seriously this is one of those movies that you gotta watch to laugh at. The movie does have a lot of action scenes,stuff blowing up, people dodging bullets. and none of them are realistic. The good thing this movie boosts is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a few of lame one liners, it even breaks the third wall in one sceneThe movie tells the story of a recently discharged marine; he arrives home to begin a new life with his wife. They decide to take a road trip, have a good time together, but his wife gets kidnapped oh noo! Yeah so now Mr. Marine must save her. In the process he beats a lot of bad guys. Anyway it's an okay movie to watch when there's nothing on the teliMY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5"
2615.5."marine thanks for getting my movie here so quick. we really enjoy and its in great shape that is great thanks"
2616.2."I know John!! Son went to High School with him!! I did not like it very much...bought it because of the fact that my son went to high school with him and thought it would be nice to have. It was not as much action as I thought it would be....a little dull...but not bad for his first...know he will get better as the ""Rock"" did!!!"
2617.2.":0( BOOO! first the acting was so so so bad the movie, this is what i have to say ?but they get E for effort."
2618.2."Action Lots of action, but totally unbelievable, just like watching wrestling. Amusing enough to watch but not to own."
2619.4."The Marine Good action the previews show the good part of the movie. Good plot ending could have benn better."
2620.1.this movie is uber lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! & uber boring!!!!!! this movie stinks i hate this movie and this movie has ripped off rambo yes this movie ripped off rambo this movie stinks the director the producers the actors and actresses all stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is easily one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2621.4."Pretty Cool Movie I thought this movie was pretty cool for the most part. Robert Patrick's role also added to it's success and suspense. Lots of action and the storyline was well written. Maybe John Cena is the next big action star to Hollywood and to action movies in general. I think if he continues to make them like this, he will be. Thought it was better than 12 rounds as well.Peter J. Miller"
2622.1.Laughably stupid I gave this movie 1 star for only one reason Kelly Carlson is beautiful,other than that the movie goes as follows,marine gets dishonorably discharged and seems to be ok with it,wife gets kidnaped,he gets beat up,knocked out several times,gets burned,blown up,by the most overdone explosions and walks away without a scratch,this movie is pure hollywood,it was a waste of money and time,you really have to wonder if the producers ever spent any time in the military,I have never met a marine worth his salt that had to go telling everyone (Im a marine), every soldier I have ever known that talks like that was always in some bar fight or some other altercation with someone,It was a laughably stupid movie
2623.1."One of the worst movies ever Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in movies. The Rock is doing it, Hogan did it for a bit. I did enjoy wwe's other movies but this...this was just plain bad. Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good"
2624.1."what a waste john cena has to be the worst actor in history, wiht corny quote and stare one after another, it just shows how fargone the world of film has become, i honestly cant belive how people can pay for this. not only is john cena annoying his acting is unbearable, its worse then wacthing george bush's innauguration...dont buy it, your waisting your money, its a joke, i honestly dont get how someone could watch him unless ypu think he attractive, which unless you like people who act what their not, then he's ur type john cena is the worst thing to happen to wrestling"
2625.1."Typical action film with strange attempt at humor This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous."
2626.2."Mildly entertaining at best This movie had bad acting and a thin plot. Could have been much better. Lots of action, lots of explosions but didn't seem like a good Blu-ray quality movie. It killed 2 hours but nothing i would recommend to a friend to watch."
2627.1."Ha-Ha-Ha... If the cover for this low-brow action piece wasn't a hint, then you're probably one of the producers target audience. One of the things I think hurts hollywood is its irrepressible desire to shove the American flag down our throats by making these ""patriotic"" movies. We have the American flag, Iraq, marines... and wrestling!!! I guess if cow-tipping is a hobby you enjoy as much as practicing a suplex, then this movie is for you.As for a review, it stank. If you see it on the shelf of your local video store, leave it there.If you're a hollywood producer, please stop making movies starring wrestling ""stars"". If your name is Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, John Cena (The Rock is OK) please stick to your day jobs."
2628.4."NON-STOP ACTION YOU HAVE TO LIKE THE THE ACTION SCENES AND STUNTS. WILD.... ALITTLE FAR OFF IN NEVERLAND. AND IF YOU LIKE JOHN CENA THEN YOU HAVE TO SEE IT. BUT ALL IN ALL A PRETTY OK MOVIE."
2629.3."The Marine - Mini Review A group of diamond thieves kidnap the wife of a recently discharged marine who goes on a chase through the South Carolinian wilderness to retrieve her."
2630.4."For hard core action fans. This is one for the hard core action fans. There's very little 'down time' to run for popcorn. If someone isn't getting shot, punched, etc. things are getting blown up or sunk in water. There is an action scene I haven't seen yet with a police car. Several of the action scenes are worth a rewind and I did appreciate the 'buff bodies'. You have to give these guys an A plus for working out.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2631.2."Marine Comedy This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive, take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up, and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh."
2632.1."new answer to the question ""What the worst movie next to Missing in Action I""? This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life."
2633.5."Non-stop action from beginning to end! I was skeptical of this movie featuring a WWE wrestler (WWE wrestlers are notoriously bad actors) and because the movie was produced by the WWE rather a than a major motion picture company. However I was wrong. The movie was full of action and special effects. John Cena did a respectable job acting. The theme and plot were very entertaining, not cheesey or bogus. If you like action movies such as ""Arnold"" movies or Rambo movies then you will very much enjoy this movie!"
2634.3."a MAN movie Basicly this story is about a retired marine whose whife gets kidnaped from a hostage situiation. Well it's definatly action packed...but not completly true to life. Lots of explosions and fight sceans that are unnecessary. But it is very fun to watch if you don't mind random cars blowing up all over the place."
2635.1."Bad... ...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II""."
2636.1."made me ashamed to have served This is the first time that I've ever felt so compelled to write a review for a movie I thought was horrible. But this movie is that bad.I can't believe someone actually enjoyed this.The one liners, and that whole rock candy thing??? What was that all about? Was that supposed to be funny?Who wrote this anyway? He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.The acting was also some of the worst I've seen. I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.Oh, the explosions were impressive. Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.Thanks. I feel a little ""dumber"" for having sat through the whole thing."
2637.3."The Marine John Cena was very realisitic, made the part genuine and intriguing. He really portrayed a man going out of his mind with anger at his wife being kidnapped. At the same time, he was clever and covert. It is unfortunate that with his talent and great looks, he was given a substandard plot. He has untapped skills and a charisma that could make him a tremendous movie star in a story that is unique and capitalizes on his expertise."
2638.1."Great score, terrible quality The music on this album could be incredible.However, there is low-level line noise on every track, the audible range of the tracks seems like it's been ""chopped"", making all the tracks sound ""muddled."" One track should flow seamlessly to the next, but the mastering between tracks results in extreme volume level changes.I am by no means an audiophile, but the MP3 quality for this album is just terrible. (I don't know if the same mastering issues exist for the cd version of this album)."
2639.4."Excellent Modern-day, Tragic, Choir Score.... The score by Craig Armstrong is brilliant. If you're a Hans Zimmer fan or like Graeme Revell, Trevor Rabin, etc. Then you'll love this CD. Filled with vocal pieces which are tragic, but still keep in touch with today's times. Hymn, Ruby, Ball, Hanging & Disaster are tracks to look out for. Great Cd if you liked the Crow, Devil's Advocate, Crimson Tide & The Negotiator."
2640.2."Disappointing on several levels There is only a brief introduction to the images and the period this coloring book covers. That was one star off. However, we do need to keep in mind that this is supposed to be a coloring book, target audience probably children though frankly I know many adults who adore these sorts of books. The images however not simple black and white lines drawings but have shading and that interfers with coloring. Also many of the images are ""blurry"" or so details that I don't think it is much fun to color. But it could be a cool reference for clip art or examples of the gothic style."
2641.1."heavily inked in plate repros of circa 1875 designs Almost useless as a true coloring book due to the heavily inked in gothic designs. Some of the designs are highly detailed and intricate, yet totally useless because most of it is inked in already. The entire book consists of gothic clip art style 1875 ink-plate repros of gothic pillars, gothic crown molding, etc. The images are printed back to back on quality white stock paper, however, markers bleed through. NO limited recopy rights at all, not even for our own use. Not even just to recopy so we can use markers. The price does not justify the product at all.This is not a Dover Publication, it was published by Stemmer House Publishers. Best to stick with Dover, at least with Dover you know you're getting top quality in all aspects."
2642.4."Lorna Doone - a Classic ! I was pleasantly surprised to find this book so readable- even by modern standards it is a good read, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even ..... but if you can deal with that, this is a good bet for anyone who would like a tale of England in the late 1600's... love, adventure, and even a little humor too!"
2643.3."archaic book i wonder why nobody has reviewed this book. i think it because it has not been read in many years.it makes me think of a popular cooky."
2644.2."good idea, bad product i brought this gift with high hopes. Sadly, those hopes came crashing down pitifully. I admit that sony had a great idea. In fact, it would have been perfect for me because I'm always wondering who sang THAT song on the radio.It's cute and small, but not for a keychain. In addition, the USB capability is really handy (at least for newer computers). The product is a lot like its website--cute, stylish, but not practical. I disliked having the radio station settings so limited and the song information arriving so slowly.I would recommend holding off for a better product."
2645.2."New Technology Needs Help The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the ""24 Hour"" wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs."
2646.3."Good Unit - But Support is Terrible I just got my Emarker in the mail and I am pretty impressed with the hardware. However, the driver support is terrible. I got fustrated and starting playing with the Win98 drivers provided and I got them to work under Windows 2000!! If you are interested in the drivers email moon@home.com and I will sent them over to you. I hope this helps someone out there that wants to play with this unit but Sony doesn't care about U!"
2647.3."Great Idea, Things Need Improvement Great idea for a product, but needs some improvements, which may or may not happen. Great idea for those times you here a song you want to check out again.Giving it a lower rating because the software does not load on Windows 95 or Me machines. Also, no coverage for jazz or classical stations, as stated above, which would truly make this a remarkable product."
2648.1."Useless!! I was sold this item only to learn, after opening the corresponding Web site necessary for eMarker function, that Sony was terminating the corresponding Web service in 45 days!!A great idea but no support."
2649.1."emarker.com to shut down 9/30/2001 Do not buy the emarker. It is being shut down by Sony on 9/30/2001. I received the following email from emarker.com on 9/5/2001:We will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01.To keep your eMarks information, just print the screens from your eMarks pages.For eMarker refund information, please click here.(emarker.com)Thanks for your support.The eMarker Team"
2650.3."It works, but good taste is still a few years down the road Sure, it probably does what it's supposed to do from a technical standpoint, but it's only going to cultivate more awareness of the music that we already hear too much about as it is. If you have tastes that go at all beyond the most commercial and mainstream in music, you'll most likely be disappointed to find out that very few small, independent, and/or college radio stations currently put their playlists on the e-Marker Web site. And knowing how operations and budgets work at these stations, it might be a while before you're able to e-Mark and research any tunes you wouldn't be able to get by flipping the channel and waiting 4 minutes. As an idea, the e-Marker is viable, but I'm still supplementing my car stereo with my pen, paper, and open ears."
2651.4."great if you live in a big city I brought myself a emarker, which is just more than a glorified time stamp it sets up easly, works fine and is for me a usefull product, if you live in a big city like ny or la the site is updated every 10-15 minutes it seems that outside the big areas your SOL.. its a neat little gadget and good if you live in an area where its updated frequently."
2652.4."Great product, but a little inconvenient This works like a dream to find out what song is playing on the radio. There are two problems I have, however. One is the hassle of hooking it up to your computer and waiting a day to find out what song it is. In cities with a large population, the songs get updated every 10 minutes. The other is the heavy flash use on the web site. This makes the process of finding out the song even longer. I do not have a high-speed connection, just a 56k modem. Even with these problems, the great function of this product makes it original and worth your money."
2653.3."Cool looking but not practical I'd classify this device as a toy for adults, not for everyday use. It looks cool and is fun to play with, but the use is somewhat limited. While it's good in the car, you'll have to remember the station the radio was set to. And if you're in a waiting room or other place that plays radio music, you probably won't know or remember the station it was when you get home. Also, there's often a delay of 24 hours in many areas before you can check what the station was playing.This device would have been much more useful if it was instead a feature of a handheld radio, because then it could automaticlly record the station."
2654.2."Good if you listen to ONE radio station at all times! I live in Phoenix, AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker. The main problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before the radio and song information is updated on E-marker's web page. Also, if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker. Trust me, it is hard to remember which one of your 3 listed radio stations you were listening to, especially if it was more than 24 hours ago - I thought the whole point behind this product was to let you not remember!"
2655.2."Good idea, needs LOTS of work The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking. I live in NYC, media capital of the world, and if it doesn't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations, it won't work anywhere. If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing. It is very unreliable, I have yet to see it work more than 3 times, and I have owned it for well over a month. If you want to get it, DON'T. At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point."
2656.1."ABSOLUTE GARBAGE PRODUCT Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest."
2657.3."Good idea, not executed very well This is a pretty good idea, but most people don't realize that it doesn't know what radio station you are listening to. You have to change that manually. Also, some radio stations are not listed. I put it in my car for a few days, but I haven't used it in a while. I think most people will end up doing that. They should give this thing out for free and support it through advertising, because it isn't worth [the money]."
2658.1."Not Needed -- Free Alterative This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)"
2659.2."Small Device... Huge Disappointment When I first heard about this I was elated, no more guessing what the song I was listen to is called. Then I connected to the website. At the time I had a 28K modem. Trying to access Sony's flash-enabled site was undesirable, if not impossible. I had to wait half an hour just to figure out what a three minute song was called. Also, the fact I still had to write down the station I was listening to. Doesn' that defeat the purpose of this toy?"
2660.3."nice usb cable, shame about the product It's worth ... for the nice USB cradle which you can use with any device ( i use my mp3 player in it ).the device itself, and the service is pretty useless. It's often provided me with the wrong song, and don't count on it having the station you're listening to. the software you download really stinks and is way too flashy (it's always resident in the system tray)it's fun to bash it on a desk though, it has a very nice rubbery feel...."
2661.1."waste of cash This was the biggest waste of money ever created. If you want to know the song that much, call the station and ask them, they don't mind, really."
2662.1."THE WORST THING EVER CREATED I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!"
2663.1."Don't do it! It's still in beta... Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it ""automatically"" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true..."
2664.1."worthless Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to ""enable"" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work."
2665.1."rip off no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony"
2666.5."This service works great! I'm really happy with this eMarker thing. I mark songs with it almost everyday on WPLJ and I download the songs from Napster. I do have to wait for about 3-10 minutes (sometimes less) to get the song name, but I'm usually in the car so it is not really a problem. It would be great if they covered NPR. It works on my Windows 2000 PC at work and my Windows ME PC at home. The technology behind it seems to be pretty simple. I think the keychain product just remembers the time. It works flawlessly for my station, which is what is important anyway. The site is a bit slow, but it is a really slick design that is very interactive. I wish it held more songs than ten."
2667.1."SLOW very very slow Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."
2668.2."Another thingabob on a key chain E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain."
2669.1."CAREFUL! SONY rips you off! I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-("
2670.1."Sony has pulled the plug Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them."
2671.1."Does what it says, BUT. . . This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review. Current users are being offered a refund, but my guess is if you buy one now you won't get that.I'd write more detail, but I have to go print hardcopies of my eMarks. :("
2672.1."eMarker shutting down 30th September 2001 Check their web site at www.emarker.com. A pity. This looked like a good idea. :-("
2673.1."It only remembers the time, not the station. Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
2674.1."Terrible I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK."
2675.1."Worthless Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one."
2676.3."website offline Although this product did work fine, the website has been shutdown which will now make this product useless if you purchase it."
2677.2."Challenging This unit is quite difficult to use. The button is very sensitive, which sometimes causes false entries. The website is complicated to use. I think with a little work E-marker will be a good product to have."
2678.1."Don't buy this Junk Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk."
2679.1."Out of Business These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer."
2680.3."Some flaws.... The Sony Emarker is a good idea, but it needs some flaws worked out first. But first, the Pros. 1.Long battery life 2.Again, it's a really good idea. 3.Very compact-fits in your pocket well.The Cons! 1.The keychain is low quality. It broke after 2 weeks. 2.You usually have to wait a day to find out what your song is. 3.The ""mark"" button is very easy to get pressed while in your pocket. 4.You have to lesten to 1 station. This is a lot worse than it sounds. 5.Sometimes, Sony won't have the song you want. 6.Only some of the songs have clips so you can recognize your song. Without this you can't know what song you marked. 7.There are many stations you can't choose to have as your station. Make sure to check this before you buy this. Goto www.emarker.com to check for coverage. 8.Major Problem! If you do not install the Emarker in the order the instructions say to, you will have some major problems!Overall....I think you should wait for a new and better model. Bye!Bradley"
2681.1."Ruined by neutering the artwork I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book."
2682.3."Scary Stories Scary Stories, a book for enthusiastic young readers. A book ofstories collected by Alvin Schwartz. These ""Scary Stories""range from classics and myths to newer stories such as ""The Hook"". Also included are gruesome black and white illustrations. Small childrem will scream at these horror stories, but older kids will laugh at the fictitious tales. With 104 pages of stories the book will last awhile. I recommend this book for young readers ages 1-12."
2683.1."Not the Nightmare-fuel from my childhood Don't waste your time or money. Buck up and spend the extra for an original Stephen Gammell illustrated version. If you're buying it for a kid who may in fact be a total wiener, then by all means get this one. But then, why are you buying the little wiener horror stories?Stephen Gammell's version will help develop a child's hippocampus and exercise their innate terror response. This one is lame."
2684.1."These are not the Stephen Gammel illustrations!! I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries. I have the originals and I will keep them for posterity."
2685.1."A watered down version of the original I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book."
2686.1."Worthless Edition. Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools."
2687.1."How Dare They... How dare they censor the original?? The Stephen Gammel illustrations were incredible! The art was what made these books great! The writing is still good, but the new drawings are just nowhere near as good as the old ones! Skip this one and buy the old version(s)!!"
2688.1."Missing what made the original versions great: The art! Alvin Schwartz's stories always played second fiddle to Stephen Gammell's art. Without it, this book is not worth anyone's time or money. Avoid it and seek the originals."
2689.1."Also displeased with the new art. As another child who was scarred by the terrifying art style in the original books, I was extremely excited to hear about the re-release of these classic stories. The books arrived today; lo and behold the original art has been replaced with bland, uninteresting art that would be better suited in an R.L. Stine novel.A wasted purchase..."
2690.5."INSANELY SCARY,MAN! This book is scary stuff! I read a story, ""Me-Tie-Doughty-Walker"" that scared the stuffing out of me! Now I'm in seventh grade, and the book still gives me chills when I'm reading it alone! The pictures are so trippy and disturbingly graphic!"
2691.4."Scary Stories If you like scary stories you will like this because it is scary. The book I am reading has dead people in it. Dead people come alive and kill people. Then they would eat that person.Some of the dead will just walk away. Then, the person who sees that dead person freaks and dies. The ghost of the dead person will just walk away. Finally when one the guys or girls run so fast they bump right into the ghost or the dead person and just kill that person who bumps into them."
2692.4."Scary stories you'll remember for years Horrifying and haunting short stories illustrated with mentally disturbing sketches. I used to pull this book out at slumber parties and we'd all freak ourselves out. I still remember some of the short stories to this day."
2693.1."Artwork??? Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS."
2694.1."The art is a joke This isn't the original art for these books. They hired a cheap hack to make the illustrations ""less scary"". The original had a better artist and better illustration. Dont waste your time on this pussified version."
2695.1."Scary Stories that are no longer scary. The original books contained haunting, even downright frightening illustrations that still disturb me to this day. They made these stories scary. They were original, artistic, beautiful and downright horrifying, and have been replaced by bland, boring, and shamefully dull. If you want something that will scare you, find a copy of this book with the original artwork by Stephen Gammel."
2696.1."These are not the books you grew up with... Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself."
2697.1."Do Not Buy This Edition Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special."
2698.4."PERFECT FOR TELLING AROUND THE CAMPFIRE! SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK has classic campfire stories, such as ''The Hook'', and ''Me-Tie Daughty Walker'' along with lesser known tales like ''Alligators'' and ''May I Carry Your Basket''? Some stories are funny, such as ''The Viper'' (I've come to vipe your vindows) and ''The Ghost With Bloody Fingers'' (cool it dude, get a band-aid) while others are genuinely spooky, like ''The Guests'' and ''Cold as Clay''. The book was clearly intended for reading out loud, many stories even have tips for the reader, such as when to raise and lower your voice. Stephen Gammell's pictures are mysterious and darkly beautiful. I highly recommend this book for those looking for a spooky read aloud."
2699.4."Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark didn't really have much of a plot, since it is a collection of short stories. In one of the stories, The Girl who Stood on the Grave, the plot is a girl was given a dollar to prove that if you stand on a grave, then the person who's grave it was wouldn't grab you and pull you under. She was to stick a knife in the grave so her friends know she was there. She put the knife through the grave, and tried to get away, but she that she was being held back, and she died of fright. The setting is at a graveyard at night. The conflict is that the girl tried to prove the fact that if you stand on a grave at night, then the person under it will pull you in wrong. It wasn't resolved, but the girl died of fright because she thought she was being pulled under, when she had just put the knfe through her dress on accident."
2700.5."Scary as heck! This, along with the other two books in the series, is a classic. Alvin Schwartz's tales are so simple yet so deviously scary, and Gammell's dark, surreal illustrations greatly enhance them. Actually, some of the illustrations are midly disturbing...(what IS that thing coming up the stairs in ""The Voice""?) Once you've read at least a couple of them, you'll start to realize just how scary the world is...(for instance, ""The Girl who Stood on a Grave"", ""The Red Spot"", and ""No Thanks""). So give them a try...you won't be dissapointed!"
2701.5."NIGHTMARES YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}."
2702.3."NOT VERY SCARY MY HUSBAND GOT THIS BOOK TO READ TO OUR 7 YEAR OLD NIECE. NOT VERY INTERESTING AND DEFINATELY NOT SCARY. IT WASN'T WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR."
2703.3."IT WAS FUNNY SCARY STORYby ALVIN SCHWARTZTHE BOOK IS A GOOD BOOK.IT TELLS ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENTSCARY STORIES.FOR INSTANCE THE FIRST SCARY STORYWAS CALLED BOO MEN.IT WAS ABOUTTHREE MEN WHO DIED IN THEREHOME.THEN CAME BACK TO HONTAND KILL THE PEOPLE LIVINGIN HIS HOUSE.I WOULD RecommendTHIS BOOK BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY ANDIT'S A GOOD HALLOWEEN BOOK."
2704.2."Jake's I did not like this book because it was not like a complete story. It just had little mini stories in it. I also did not like it because some of the authors who wrote the stories did not finish them. One more reason is there are a lot of pages, but it is not hard so it makes it too easy to read.The book Scary Stories is a book filled with about 10 different stories. It is very scary andit just makes you want to scream! This book will scare its reader half to death.The type of reader that would like this book is maybe someone who watches a lot of horror movies. The reason is because it really scares you. The reader would also have a strong stomach because it is a gross book."
2705.2."Scary when I was little, not years later. I first found this book when i was little--and yeah, then it scared me more. I found it recently in barns and nobles, and wanted to buy it to re read it. Big mistake.This book is more hysterical than scary to me. I didn't even feel a little scared. Big disappointment for me. my advice? read it when you are younger, it might acutally be scary then."
2706.2."Warning for customers Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition."
2707.1."This was just a mistake. Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."
2708.1."Bring back Gammell The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. Congratulations on putting out an edition that looks exactly like every other scary stories for kids book, instead of the ONE that literally everyone remembers from their childhood.Great way to commemorate the anniversary."
2709.1."""I Can Read"" book has better illustrations While the stories in the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" book remain the same, the Stephen Gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy-coated pictures.How candy-coated? Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, ""In A Dark, Dark Room"", which was written for Level 2 of the ""I Can Read!"" children's collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark."""
2710.1."Buy the original. I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed."
2711.1."The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not... I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the ""scary"" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it's a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator."
2712.5."Wow, so creepy as a child! Okay, I had all three books when I was a kid. The original ones look like their worth some money so I'll be kicking myself in the back later. If these new ones stay true to the stories from the 90's editions, then you need to buy all three of them for your kids. The stories are pretty freaky for kids, but if I recall, most of them do state some lessons to be learned. Definitely buy all three."
2713.2."Not what I remembered as a kid... This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple ""classic"" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile"
2714.2."Good for younger readers [Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will enjoy it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven Kind book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier."
2715.2."Disappointed I was disappointed with this book. I expected ""real"" ghost stories with substance. The book only has short folklore legends."
2716.4."ain't nothing like the new jack swing yep yep that was my last favorite era in the R&B movement and talk about a musical gumbo? it had so much pressence and flavor. alot of important acts came along during this time period.great hybrids of styles,beats and grooves. so many incredible talents on this compilation."
2717.4."History of Fantasy Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom."
2718.2."Average Lost Civilization Fantasy Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5.5/10The writing style is good and all the elements of a great story are present. If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right. Perhaps the author felt that a simple adventure needed a twist of some sort. Well it did feel twisted, but not in a good way.Claus Kellermann2006 April 15Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"
2719.5."Great Jam!! This is truly wonderful gooseberry jam. It is packed with chunks of gooseberries. I highly recommend this product!! It truly met my expectations."
2720.3."Quite a good course, but not compared to Tuldava's For some reason, the Indiana University has published two different courses in Estonian. This one, and the Estonian Textbook by Juhan Tuldava. While this book is certainly as good as many other language courses on the market, it falls short of the level reached by Tuldava's course, both in terms of user friendliness and in depth cover. For this reason, I would recommend Tuldava's Estonian Textbook rather than this course."
2721.1."Racism and Sex This would have been a very short book if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this."
2722.3."No water sound With the step fountain there is no water fountain noise, maybe a good thing for some people. I wanted to hear the water effects for my office but this didn't make any noise, but its nice to look at. I'm going to try the rock style fountain."
2723.2."Bellydance Magical Motion I am a first-timer and it can be rather intimidating to admit for an older woman in her mid-forties! I wanted a video that was decent, and this one surely is. Atea's moves were clear and it helped me to get a good start, but I quickly became bored with it because it lacked FLOW, and I was disappointed that the moves that she so clearly shows do not connect together to form a dance routine. This is what I am looking for. For a beginner to be expected to make a dance out of a bunch of new moves is unrealistic, and I will continue to look for a video that will offer this. If I am to dance like this in front of my husband, (which is mainly why I am learning) I would not be able to show him a routine by learning this video because I am a beginner and don't know how to put the moves together yet. The whole idea is BellyDANCE, and not just Belly EXERCISE, and with the CONFIDENCE I need to dance this way!"
2724.3."It's ok but I'm glad I bought it used. I have purchased several other bellydance dvds and videos and I will say I'm glad I purchased this one used for a lesser price. I don't care about the age of the video or the costumes or makeup... I was looking for instruction and I really didn't find it here. I found her not exceptionally easy to follow and I don't think much time was taken for those of us who are novices to bellydance. I can't afford to take lessons where I live so I am having to rely on video and dvd. This one really hasn't been all that helpful for me. Others may be able to follow her better than me but I haven't found her teaching style to be one easy for me to grasp and follow."
2725.4."Atea's a classic! Just so everyone knows, Atea is NOT that stiff in real life! She must be camera-shy (a lot of us are). She is an excellent dancer, although she could use a bit of meat on her. Still, for basic moves and correct technique, it's a good starter video."
2726.2."disappointing I was very dissapointed with the quality of this video. During the entire video, you could see the woman reading the cards behind the camera. The ladies did not teach any moves that you could not just make up on your own."
2727.2."very simple interpretation of bellydance I take group bellydance classes and have been to seminars and workshops. This is bellydance but only the very simplest form. Atea is ok and this is a good tape to start with if you are not sure how serious you are about learning. It introduces you to things like veil and zills but it does not instruct you on them. If you are sure you want to dance you should shop around spend just a little more money getting a tape from someone/troup that dances a style you are interested in and has a well known face and name. For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several."
2728.2."beginners only, maybe Beginners who would like a quick view into some dance might take advantage of this video. There is an attempt to cover a lot of ground, but none of it is done well. Altea is too angular, stilted and her dancing is not that interesting. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for quality dance instruction videos. I will say that this is the first video that I've seen that touches on rhythm and zill work. The variety in costume is interesting, but is not worth the price. I recently acquired several of the Neena and Veena series of dance tapes. These are excellent beginner tapes, they are fun and interesting and they show a great little dance at the end as a reward for your work-out. This series would be a better choice for beginners."
2729.1."It's a shame there are not 0 stars on ratings Reasons not to buy this video:1. She reads from cue cards the entire time.2. She's extremely stiff and boring.I have only watched this video once in the two years that I have owned it."
2730.1."Scary I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like."
2731.2."There are far better tapes out there... If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance."
2732.1."Frail White Women Wriggle About While the basic instruction is passable, the technique of most of the dancers, including the instructor, is mediocre to poor. What's truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There's an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a ""wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband"" sort of vibe. Culturally divorced and ugly-American scary. Made me want to shave my head and get tattoos."
2733.2."should have known better For basic instruction this tape is OK. Her oral description of the techniques is clear. Atea is not relaxed at all in her instructions or moves. In the instruction part of the video she seems like a puppet controlled by strings. She is too skinny, unattractive and doesn't even have an attractive navel. She fails to hold your attention. Her other dancers are a bit better, but the whole tape seems so contrived and does not move with a natural flair. For verbal instruction, OK, for visual efects you can get much better. And the dance at the end is a real joke. Your money is better spent on Suhaila!"
2734.2."Disappointed This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to ""freestyle"" and ""improvisation"". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy."
2735.2."Not My Favorite I found this tape very disappointing, it was fun to watch once, but the amount of information provided was very small and too choppy. There are many belly dance instructional videos available which are more interesting, better taught and more informative about how to dance and which provide you with a workout as well. My recommendation is to keep looking."
2736.4."Newbie Review This video has advantages over the others I have bought in several ways-The photography is clear and moves close enough to the dancers (in the relevent area) to allow someone new like me to actually understand what they are doing.She explains clearly what she is doing. Pretty rare!The secondary dancers are different from segment to segment highlighting thier strengths and getting a better taste for different styles.There are dance sections showing how the moves just shown can be used in dance.Overall- Good! Wish I could find a teacher in Las Vegas."
2737.1."Unreliable Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail."
2738.4."Dope. But divisive statements like the one above (or is it below) about D-12 are not needed in hip-hop. If you can't say something nice...."
2739.1."Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."
2740.2."The original recording probably sounded good, but the mastering on this CD is poor... Whoever mastered this CD had no idea what they were doing (this makes me wonder what other CDs on this label are like). They use about one-quarter of the dynamic range available with 16-bit audio. Five bucks is pretty cheap for the disc, but you get what you pay for in this case. I'd probably opt for the other Eddie Fisher CD that has multiple albums (one of them being a Christmas CD) on it."
2741.4."An atmospheric look at Morocco This is one of the better books I've seen that gives a real feeling for Morocco, their lifestyle, culture, colours, ambience etc. There's a wonderful balance of writing and photographs (none of which are ""touristy"" style pics!). it's one of those pieces where you can read & finish, and come away with a real feeling for the place, and a real respect for it's historical contexts.My only downer is that the bookbinding technique is miles too lightweight for pages of this quality and weight, and on just the second opening the stem came unstuck and fell apart. Still, with some tender loving care this will stay on top of the coffee table for years to come.Worth grabbing if you have a romanticised love of north Africa and it's people."
2742.3."LIVING IN MOROCCO BOOK ARRIVED IN POOR CONDITION WITH THE BACK UNGLUED. OTHERWISE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PHOTO ESSAY"
2743.3."Living in Morocco This is a beautiful book. Unfortunately, the cover broke away from the binding after only a couple readings."
2744.1."mediocre i didn't care for this cd. it is a Christian goth group that has disappeared and I can see why. not anything special. if you are a collector of christian goth, a friend of the bands, or a fan then get it otherwise don't waste your time."
2745.4."Idaho Geology If you want to know how Idaho is assembled geologically, this is for you. It is the most readable book on the topic and more complete than other tomes. I strongly recommend it for the amateur geologist."
2746.3."Good read for the price I thought this collection was ace! The one set in the museum was the best. It was kind of creepy and sad in parts but has a very interesting story and the end explains a lot. If you have kids, they will like this one too.I did not like so much ""M.C. Higgins the Great"" which I thought was more for boys. I didn't read this one though so I don't know what it's about except for the first five pages.For all your parents out there my Mom liked ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankwiler"" as well. If you liked reading you will like this even if you are any age at all.I am still reading ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimth"",I also recomend ""When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit"" in another book."
2747.4."SYNTHASIZED HARMONY ELECTRIC SYKCHURCH IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF TODAYS RAVE SCENE. WANDERING THROUGH YOUR BODY LIKE A FLOW OF POSITIVE ENERGY. ITS A GREAT GROUP TO LISTEN TO, WHEN THE SUN IS COMING UP, AT A DESERT PARTY. A PERFECT END TO A NIGHT OF DANCING."
2748.5."Amazingly beautiful trance cd. This is the perfect cd to put in after a night of partying. Great to chill out to. Track 5 and 6 are just amazing."
2749.5."awesome This has to be the best group of performers I've ever enjoyed. I've seen them 4 times.. well 5 times.. once on the 55 freeway.. :P This is cd is very creative and will set you in the mood that will take your mind away from everyday life.. GET IT!!! -Darkpeace (Moontriber 4 life)"
2750.3."Not true to size I purchased a pair of these in size 14 Wide. The boots I received were labeled as wide. They fit like mediums though. If you have a regular foot width, I am sure these boots are good because my wife owns a pair in regular width and she likes them."
2751.3."Really wanted to like these.... I really wanted to like these boots, because they feel solid and comfy, but they were too small around the toes - side to side. I usually wear a 7W, so I got both 7W and 7.5W, and both were to small across the toe. I may try 8W."
2752.3."VERY Narrow, poor inserts I want to like these boots. They are pretty well made, and look like they will last a good while. They have one significant issue - they fit my foot, but are very stingy with material around the ankle bones. Almost not enough tongue to cover, but only where the ankle joint is widest. I have never had a boot fit this way.Secondly, the inserts are useless, and had to be thrown out immediately.I will wear them for a while and see how they fare, and I may revise his review."
2753.2."Tongue hurt my ankle The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately, the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe. Didn't matter which sock I wore. I had to return."
2754.4."Great product Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
2755.5."Nice boot I bought these for my boys for Christmas and they love them so much they refuse to take them off. They told me these are the best pair of shoes/boots they have ever had."
2756.3."nice boot The boot was well priced and solidly built but not true to size.I would go at least a half size smaller."
2757.4."Good Deal On Amazon I have bought about 20 pair of these boots over the past 6 or 7 years. I usually buy them 2 pair at a time and wear one for work and one for good.Even when you buy them at the buy one get one half price in stores the price on here is by far cheaper than anywhere else.They are comfortable, waterproof, last a long time and are light weight."
2758.3."Sizing off These seemed like good quality boots, however the sizing was 1/2 a size off. I ended up returning the product so I can't speak for actual comfort or longevity of product. But it is frustrating when a product doesn't fit. Shoes are usually pretty constant too. I purchased these particular ones based on all the great reviews but I didn't see any that commented on sizing issues, so just beware."
2759.5."Excellent Boots! These boots are an excellent value. They are comfortable, provide great heel and ankle support, good grip, and keep your feed warm and dry in cold climates.Purchased a pair for a vacation in New Brunswick, Canada. These boots kept my feet dry and comfortable the whole time, even while snow shoeing and hiking across a snow covered beach front. Didn't slip once in them, though I encountered ice a few times.Very good purchase!"
2760.4."Men's High Tec Boot This boot is comfortable and gives me the ankle support I've needed for any type of hiking. I look forward to many years of use from these boots."
2761.4."Good Boots Comfotable fit on the loose side. I use a heavier sock and works just fine. Recommended and would buy again."
2762.5."Hi-Tec Altitude I first purchased a pair of Hi-Tech Altitude boots approximately 10 years ago. They fit me extremely well and were very comfortable from the first moment I wore them. Prior to this purchase, I have had 2 different pairs of the Hi-Tech Altitude boots and I have not been disappointed. They wear extremely well and seem to last me about 4 or 5 years. I have found them excellent for everyday wear as well as for use in fishing and hunting. I think these are excellent low cut boots for such a moderate price. Haven't ventured into buying the $100+ boots, but then why should I when these work so well, so can not comment or compare my $70 Hi-Techs to the more pricey boots. I think you will be pleased with these boots."
2763.4."Good Boot These are very nice boots. Love the styling and appearance. They do need to be broken in a little when you first get them."
2764.5."Only shoe my husband will wear Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future."
2765.4."Look Good These boots feel and fit great. I am interested in how long they will hold up. They look pretty sturdy. I will put them to the test for sure."
2766.2."Had to return Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles. I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just didn't work."
2767.2."Overhyped? Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box."
2768.2."Great boot, Sturdy, Comfortable, But those darn laces!! They keep coming untied! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. The boot is waterproof, it is comfortable, wont give you calluses or corns. But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it, they will inevitably become undone! The first time: ""umm? maybe I should tie them tighter"", The second time: ""just a little tighter, Ugh it's cutting my circulation"", The third time: ""Ok this is ridiculous, let me try tying em different"", the unfteenth time: ""you m$#%^ stupid $%^ Boot from hell $%^&..."" lol I threw the boots into a lake and hiked in my sandals the rest of the way... Never again will I buy boots with hooks for tying...thanks for reading"
2769.1."Cheaply made boot Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!"
2770.2."Not comfortable These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable. I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day. The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up. I would not recommend these to anyone."
2771.5."Great Boots Went to Yellowstone in these boots. They were comfortable, waterproof and did well on the 328 steps to get down to lower falls."
2772.4."Happy Feet These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!"
2773.5."Mercacia pendiente por despachar. Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking BootEste producto fue comprado y cacelado junto con una cartera para caballero NAUTICA Men's Trifold Wallent y numca fue enviado, este comentario lo he enviado muchas veses pero no me han solucionado nada, no voy a rrepatir mas este mensaje, pero no realizare mas compras por esta pajina debido a lo que esta sicediendo."
2774.5."More than one year used a lot ! Exactly I'm using this ones from 16 months, ALL the sundays, and in some trips to the mountain and beach for a complete week, they are great in all the ways! I can't hope something better from a daily used and/or hicking shoes! Another thing to consider; I'm a ""big and heavy boy"":6 ft.2 in.and 225 lbs."
2775.3.Altitude IV Expensive shoes, I was really excited about it but got a little dissapointed with it, quality little low, materials seems to be cheap
2776.3."feels well made relatively comfortable. The front of my ankle hurts if i lace it too tightly. We will see if this improves with breaking it in."
2777.4."Very comfortable These arrived quickly fit great and are very comfortable. I bought these for general use during colder months to replace sneakers."
2778.3."Not for me Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
2779.3."HiTec Boot Review This is the second time I purchased these boots. The first time (7 years ago) everything was good. This time I gave the boots a 5 week break-in period but after two days on the trail I had some pinch points, but no blisters. The real disappointment was the waterproofing. Of the 5 days I was out on the trail I had 3 days of rain or overcast. On the first day after 5 hours of wet grass I had wet feet. I was hoping to keep my feet dry this trip."
2780.3."Men's Altitude Hiking Boot These were my first pair of boots. Bought them for motorcycle safety training (needed footwear that covered the ankles) & been using them sparingly over the last year. The shoes are a nice dark shade of black but the lace rings are a little too shiny for my liking. Price could be cheaper too. No other complaints."
2781.5."Great all season Boot! I've now had these boots for a month and they just continue to impress me. They were comfortable right out of the box so break in was very quick. I've worn them day hiking and have had no problems with hot spots.Even though they are waterproof I still recommend spraying them with silicone.5 Stars!"
2782.4."Hi Tec Altitude 4 mens boot Comfortable boots that are indeed water proof and actually do breathe. They seem to work well for the winter wearing anything from cotton socks to solar socks depending on the outside temperatures. It should be noted that they do not have a slip resistance sole so they can be slippery on smooth wet surfaces. I haven't had a chance to use them in warmer weather to see fully how well they breathe. For the price they are a very good buy."
2783.3."Comfortable but felt ""Off"" These boots felt somewhat weird in their arch support. I have size 14-15 feet, and I have learned to be somewhat less picky since most stores don't carry my size. However I desired a comfortable boot that I can hike as well as work outside in. I had some LLBean boots that I worked into the ground, and unfortunately you just can't find quality that easily these days (I sound like my parents now).I cannot comment on Hi-Tec's durability or longevity because I ended up returning these boots and buying a pair of Wolverine work boots that were slightly more expensive."
2784.4."Returning Customer I'm on my 5th or 6th pair of these boots. I'm a meat cutter. I'm on my feet, in the cold for 8 hours a day. My feet are warm, dry, and comfortable. When I wear these out, I'll buy another pair. End of story."
2785.3."Runs small and narrow This review is not about the quality of the shoe (which looked quite satisfactory) but about the sizing.The shoe runs both small and narrow (even though i ordered a wide).FYI- if that happens and you have to return it- You will have to pay for the return shipping to amazon"
2786.3."They run large I ordered thise for my son for Christmas. He usually wears a 13 but would have needed a 12 in these. He didn't really like them for hiking; they are more of a work boot. You can't just ship these back to amazon; you have to pay to do it."
2787.5."Nice boots! I ordered these in fall when I was going for a backpacking trip and I could just forget about twisting an ankle or anything. Wear these, step on any kind of surface with confidence, lots of grip, good support for the ankle. Will highly recommend these for snow as well as adventure!!"
2788.4."Happy with purchase I had initially purchased a pair of Asolo Moran GTX. Although they were great boots, wearing those around the house made me realize that the right boot pinched a bit too much for my liking. Those got returned and in desperation picked up a pair of these. For the price (roughly 1/3 of the Asolo) these are fantastic boots.Break-in was fairly quick with my biggest problem area being around the shin. A strategic fold of the smartwool socks intially took care of any discomfort for the test hikes around the neighborhood. I have had no issues with the boots since then. I have deliberately stepped into streams to test the ""waterproofness"" noting no problems. The traction seemed fine.Great boots and will most likely purchase them again."
2789.4."Good boots just not waterproof.d Overall pretty good books. I just went on a 3 day Horn Hunting Hike in North East Wyoming and these boots held up good. The only downside was the boots need to be treated before plowing through snow drifts. My feet did get wet. Luckily I did have polypropelene liner socks with wool outer socks so my feet did not blister or get cold. Considering the extreme terrain and weather these boots served me well."
2790.4."This is my second pair. The first pair lasted 30 years and I'm expecting to see another winner with this pair! These boots are nice looking and well designed. I have an ankle injury which is well supported by these boots."
2791.1.not good 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
2792.1."Cheap Boots Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots."
2793.1.VERY NARROW This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
2794.1."Horrible Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear."
2795.2."Heavy and Stiff I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction."
2796.1.not up to her standards not nearly as good as her usual work if your hoping to hear her forget it it is a pale comparison with authors who don't have her style
2797.2."I'm great, everyone else stinks I am sympathetic to the perspective of this author, but not to his arrogance or all of his smug conclusions. He is too much the demagogue for my taste, liking as much to degrade as to disagree with his adversaries. This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require ""attitude."" In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien. This book doesn't belong on the shelf with Henry Mencken, who wickedly and hilariously debunked quacks. Pass on this and buy ""The Vintage Mencken"" to read his evisceration of chiropractic."
2798.1."Shameful The author is funded by the big industries which explains the selection of certain topics and the huge bias it reflects. No matter how many good reviews and bibliographic citations appear here, the ideas expressed reflect corporate interests and not scientific knowledge. Always look at the source!! Research very well where this people's funds come from and that will tell you a little bit more about the real issues."
2799.4."Good Book I used this book as a supplement to my statistics and QA courses. The book is pretty well written and points out some great examples of the misuse of statistics."
2800.2."Shows fans are starving for Kate Bush recognition I am a big fan of Kate Bush. I have collected all of her music, including her cameo appearances on other groups; yet I cannot agree with the other reviewers regarding this CD.The only good thing about this album is that most of the artists did indeed attempt to render original, different versions of Kate Bush's wonderful songs. However, I find their talent a little limited.Listening to this album made me a little sad, as it made me wish that a real tribute album to Kate Bush were released, with versions by artists such as Peter Gabriel, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Tori Amos, etc...The fact that this album was highly rated by other reviewers shows how desperate fans are for more recognition of the talent, uniqueness, and influential nature of Kate Bush's music (especially on some rather popular female artists that followed her)."
2801.2."""Desperately seeking..Kate"" Well at first when I purchased this album I was so full of hope, curiosity and impatience, because I admit I am starving for some new work of Kate Bush--hint, hint)and I know I am not alone on this one. Anyhow, I listened to it again, and again, and I realized that this is unfortunately not it. I really liked the remake of ""Suspended in Gaffa"" that was my favorite, very original (that's why the record is not 1 star), but then I quickly skipped to listen to the classic ""Running up that hill"" and...I cried, I am sorry but the remake was well below average. I agree with another reviewer who expressed the wish of having high profile artists performing Kate's awesome art, I am surprised why they haven't done it so far...However no offense to the artists who did take up on the challenge of performing Kate's songs, more power to them, however I wish they came up with something better."
2802.2."an offbeat non-standard method of casting I would not buy this again - it teaches a non-standard supposedly ""new"" methof of casting"
2803.4."Protection Advice All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction."
2804.2."Maybe good for beginners Paxton Quigley's book is a compliation of parts of other books on firearms self protection. It's a bit overdone, and probably would scare the average woman thinking about protecting herself. Women seem to have special problems protecting themselves. They usually do not want to hurt anyone, and they will do all most anything for a baby or a family member before they will do anything to protect themselves. However, women that are able to continue to practice with a hand gun, usually become quite proficent. They know that they don't know, and they listen to instructions. Most men think they know it all already."
2805.1."Not Quite A Piano Book I was looking for a piano songbook for childern to play on a piano. I should have realized it was not just the songbook from the price. It comes with an electronic toy piano. The songbook is play by numbers and this did nothing for somebody that is learning to play piano. Very disappointing. Age level is pre-school, before able to read."
2806.5."A powerful anti-war film. This is not only a spectacular and stunning piece of film making, it is a powerful anti-war film. If you can watch this film today and not be haunted and disturbed by it, you are not paying attention. I watched it recently for the first time in over 20 years and came away shaken. I can't help but wonder if it is not on DVD because there are people who do not want this film to be widely available. As it is now, you have to dig for it. If more people watched this film they might be asking questions our ""leaders"" would rather have left unasked. If you have not seen this film, or it has been a number of years since you saw it last, I can recommend it. It is not an overt anti-war film with an explicit anti-war message, but after seeing it, you will not view world events with the same eyes you did before, I promise."
2807.5."ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS AND FILM DAVID LEAN COULD HAVE DIRECTED ALMOST ANY FILM HE WANTED AT THIS TIME IN HIS CAREER, AND HE CHOSE THIS PROVOCATIVE AND EMOTIONAL STORY OF A LITTLE TOWN IN IRELAND. THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER OF HIS, INCLUDING THE EARLY ONES. THE CASTING IS SUPERB, COULD NOT BE BETTER RIGHT DOWN TO THE SMALL ROLES LIKE MAUREEN. I SAW IT WHEN I WAS 13 WITH MY PARENTS WHO WERE LEAN FANS. ITS HIS BEST FILM, TREATED BY SOME AS HIS WORST FILM. I EXPECTED TO SEE ALEC GUINESS IN IT, BUT THERE IS NO REAL ROLE FOR HIM. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PEOPLES LIVES IN THE FILM IS AMAZING AND I THINK AHEAD OF ITS TIME FOR 1970 FILM VIEWERS."
2808.2."Ryan's Revenge A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean."
2809.2."Lean Pickin's Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless."
2810.2."Irish movie The lead actress does a poor job of acting.Was recently in Ireland and stopped at the location of this film."
2811.1."customers beware When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting a good deal because of the cheaper price. However, once I received it, I knew I had made a mistake. I've been using this product for several years now, and I knew just by looking at this one that it wasn't right. The texture was incredibly thin, and the color was much lighter -- something that could only leave me to believe that maybe water had been added to it.Lesson learned -- spend the extra money -- you're paying for quality!"
2812.5."Great Beginner Camera We had used a decent quality camcorder before our son bought this one. This one has been a pleasant surprise. Although the picture quality might be more like 4 stars, the features that are provided at such a low cost make this a 5 star product. It has all the fundamentals for a beginner and it fits well in medium size and small size hands (unlike some that require two hands or very large hands or cost five times as much for a small form-factor). We had it out of the box in minutes and were recording first videos with it in less than 15 minutes. The price makes it affordable for school kids to have all kinds of fun projects with it."
2813.2."Samsung 8mm video camera The on/off switch is stuck. I cannot therefore record or review tapes. I pried the switch and made a temporary contact and confirmed that the camera can record and play-back I would like to be able to return it for full credit or have it repaired."
2814.4."Very pleased with this camcorder I just purchased this camcorder used for only $80. It is a great camera for the price. It's easy to use and the picture is good in quality. I bought it as a gift for my son (age 7) and he can handle it well on his own."
2815.2.it sounds great!~!~!~!~! it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
2816.1."Stopped working after 6 months Bought this item in July and it stopped working in December. Specficially, the playback function stopped working."
2817.1."Not worth it! This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
2818.3."Just fits by budget It was the right match for me for price-features balanced.I brough this to use it in India, the AC datapter can take in 230v/60hz and thats wonderful. The PAL feature is the one i was looking for. Its smal land compact and that makes this very handy. The Title feature provided , were you can select a title for your recodings from the list.Overall this was the best price i could get.May be two years from now, i m planning to dispose this and buy MiniDV which would cost much less than what it is now.so Untill then..SCL700 is all that i can envy about."
2819.1."Awkward controls, below-par reliability Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers."
2820.5."YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU BOUGHT THIS!!! This album is proof that Jason Robert Brown is a musician's musician, and that he has mastered many different forms of popular music. Each of these 11 songs could stand on their own as a brilliant song, and none of these have the same style or feel as another.Brown's pure talent shines through this album, and there are several moments that are just so beautiful that I just get chills listening to them. Every lyric and harmony has been precisely placed, and the music always fits the idea of the song very naturally. There are some amazing performance moments on this album; Brown is an incredible pianist and singer in addition to his composing and arranging talents.This is probably the album that I listen to more than any other, and I would recommend it to anyone. It is packed with amazing musicality.Don't listen to this while trying to get work done; these songs will steal your attention and keep it for the whole duration of the CD."
2821.2."OK I really like songs for a new world and the last 5 years. was excited to purchase this disc but was kinda disappointed. lacks the edgy variation and creativity of the others. not bad and the cover track is fun--just not up to the success of the other jason robert brown work."
2822.4."excellent resource I am fortunate enough to have Lake Douglas as an instructor. He has forgotten more about landscape architecture than most people will ever know. I love going to his class because he has a genuine passion for the subject and almost limitless knowledge. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed."
2823.4."Great Fidelity 1956 1957 Swing From Basie and Williams. What we have here is the crack ""April In Paris"" era Basie band with one Ella F track singing with Joe Williams on ""Too Close To Comfort"", a bunch of tracks with Joe taking the lead and a few great swinging instrumentals and a few alternative sides.The whole album works well, great sound,exciting music,especially if you like the croon of Joe Williams.The famous ""Joe Williams sings CD"" with Basie is considered the better,no arguing that fact, but this CD is a nice addition to your library.Great blowing on the 3 versions of One'O'clock Jump here make it all worthwhile."
2824.3."A good Count Basie record, but not an Ella record! This is a perfectly fine, swinging Count Basie record with some great Joe Williams vocals. It just annoys the heck out of me that Ella sings a duet with Williams on only one track of 13 and she gets top billing. It is a great version of ""Too Close For Comfort"". The disk also includes Joe Williams classic version of ""Smack Dab in the Middle"". Docked one star for annoying marketing."
2825.3."This shouldn't be labeled an Ella album. It's a good album, and I'd give it more stars if I hadn't thought I was purchasing an Ella Fitzgerald album. It was quite a disappointment to put the CD in my player and hear Ella's beautiful voice on so few tracks. Joe Williams is good, but he sounds nothing like Ella. This album should be refiled under Basie or Williams!"
2826.3."Good for beginners I purchased this audio book for my husband whose game is well beyond the skill level addressed in this book. He told me this book would probably be good for players hoping to break 90, who need help with developing the proper golf swing."
2827.1."Good print quality - bad mechanism I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one."
2828.3."Good Printer. . .but not without its faults I've used an HP DeskJet 990CSE as my main home office printer for over a year now. Print quality has been consistently good and I have no complaints. It doesn't print color transparencies particularly well, but I've never really expected it to, preferring, instead, to use a color laser for that stuff. I don't use the much-maligned duplexer. However, the single envelope feeder is extremely temperamental and jams frequently. I'd estimate that for every ten envelopes that I print, 3-4 jam, and some jams necessitate my opening the lid and prying the mangled envelope out. Other than the envelope path, I'm generally pleased with this printer."
2829.4."Worked like a charm My garage door was not working for 4 months.And did some research and bought this product.Right away the garage door started working great."
2830.5."RPM Sensor Assembly Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast"
2831.1."Envelope Feeder Never Worked I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one."
2832.2."Recipe for grief Until this product, I was a huge promoter of HP printers, but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility. Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX. I'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they don't work and/or freeze up my entire computer. Because of this printer I've cleaned off my entire hard drive, lost valuable files and programs, and still wound up with a non-functional machine. It's been in my closet for 6 months, and I'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer."
2833.5."Easy For Me To Use This is a good,inexpensive printer.It is easy for me,stillvery gadget illiterate,to install and use."
2834.1."Hate This Printer! Annoying messages to reset it !!! I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the ""arms"" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the ""yellow box marked !"" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!"
2835.3."Its alright... But not as good as Slo Burn or Unida (John Garcia's current band.) The music is pretty boring and the vocals are the only thing that redeems this album. Garcia's vocals are improving since the demise of Kyuss and you can tell by listening to this CD as well as material released by the aforementioned groups. ""Motherload"" is a good midpaced song with some cool riffs but it doesn't push the envelope. Only a suggestion for the die hard John Garcia fans."
2836.2."Grindhouse? I guess I'm not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud."
2837.5."Perfect choice This CD is really awesome...the style of their songs are not exactly trance, not euro dance/trance either...they have their own way of playin their songs...AWESOME CHOICE"
2838.1."Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me."
2839.1."Can't Believe This Was Even Published Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
2840.5."A wonderful helping of Brazilian jazz! This is a great CD from an extraordinary jazz saxophone player and probably the biggest name in Brazilian jazz today. We got a chance to see Leo Gandelman perform a lot of these songs at the Blue Note in June. Maracatu is a superb song...his son played it alongside him that night, it was one of the best experiences of live music I've ever heard. If you are into this type of jazz, this is a ""must have"" collection."
2841.2."The ultimate ""touchy-feely"" book. This book contains such advise as writing down personal affirmations which you will repeat to yourself at the beginning of each day:I am calm, prepared, and entertaining.I am fit and beautiful.I am humble, patient, and compassionate.I am enough, just the way I am.If this kind of advise is your cup of tea, then this is your kind of book."
2842.2."I was better off with Alexandra Stoddard.... Very much like Alexandra Stoddard's books, too much alike. Stoddard's books are less wordy and still get to the point. I stopped reading this book when the similarities became clear, been there done that. If you are looking for something in the ""guidance"" area, try Stoddard. She has many better books. I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the ""gems"" I forgot about."
2843.4."A beautifully illustrated edition of this famous tale. This new translation of the ""fairy"" story first presented by Charles Perrault (1628-1703) in his Tales of Mother Goose in 1697 was illustrated by Fred Marcellino and translated by Malcolm Arthur. It was a 1991 Caldecott Honor book (that is, a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children. The youngest son of a recently deceased miller receives a cat as his inheritance. He feels that he will soon die of starvation (after he has eaten the cat) since he has no other possessions. But, the cat convinces him to get him boots. The cat proceeds to find a fortune and a position for his young master."
2844.1."too small to read My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-("
2845.4."Illustrations!!! *** The strength of this book are the exquitely beautiful illustrations. Fred Marcellino, illustrator, is an artist extratorinare, for children's books. Another of his beloved children's books is ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier,"" which has a wonderful story! I highly recommend ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier,"" illustrated by Marcellino, with 5 stars!!!"
2846.1."Not what I expected I purchased this for my granddaughter, we love reading together. The print was WAY to small and no way to make it bigger."
2847.3."Not easy to read I purchased this story to read to my grandchildren over Thanksgiving. The drawings are delightful, but the text is hard to read (at least on my iPad). The text is supposed to become larger when you touch the screen, but it does not always work. It did for about half the book, then it just stopped. Frustrating!"
2848.3."Free SF Reader The story of a guy that is down on his luck and broke, and all he has is a cat. Lucky for him, as this cat turns out to be rather clever. It guides him to an improvement in his station, once he realises it has intelligence.They end up dealing with royalty, ogres, and other entertaining situations."
2849.3."wrong product picture These are not red and blue color coded like the picture shows. They dont even have black and red like most fiber patch cables. They are uncolored so you get to trace the length of the cable to figure out which is xmit and which is receive. Aggravating."
2850.5."EXTREMELY RARE AND HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER! Unfortunately this one won't be on cd anytime soon. A bargain at $2400 for the cassette. So rare its worth it. You won't find it anytime soon! If you make an offer you might be lucky and get it for less."
2851.2."Boring Gorecki, as usual, is striving for profound angst, but for the most part this Quartet just comes across as boring. The second and fifth movements are terrible. The first movement develops some tense themes that Gorecki could have explored further, but he drops them midway to revert back to his usual droning. The third and fourth movements are the only ones with character, with the latter developing a decent amount of bittersweet sadness."
2852.5."Deceptively good Just to be clear: the album is uniformly quiet and just consists of electric guitar without lots of special effects except long sustain. The genius of the record is that MazzaCane can bring out so much with minute details -- muffled string noises, minute pitch changes, perfect arhythmic timing of notes. Don't mistake apparent simplicity for emptiness, as another reviewer did. One of the most moving records I've heard, with a rare, sad, clear quality. I'd recommend this as a first album by this artist (he calls it his best too)."
2853.3."Marilyn Manson,The Early Years. Marilyn Manson - The Early YearsNot what I expected. Kind of boring.Not long enough.Go see his concerts instead."
2854.3."Book Review This is a most interesting, well thought out book. It give good, concise details of 9/11 events. However I think it lacked depth and could have been more detailed about what is next in terms of Port Security. More emphasis neede to be placed on this area. Worth the money, overall I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend theis book"
2855.3."Very Basic. Good Summary The book has a very basic and elementary level. Probably this is due to the great array of topics it includes. It is a very high level overview of risk management concepts. Good reading for the weekend."
2856.3."Great for the novice Risk Manager If you are a budding Risk Manager/ Officer or are considering a career move towards Risk Management, this book is a good high-level illustration of what the major sleeves of Risk Management has to offer.For the experienced risk professional, this is a bit too fundamental."
2857.4."Hard-Hitting, Witty and Astute The introductory essay alone makes this book worthwhile -- the editor traces Lasch's evolution as a historian, and shows how his interest in plain writing evolved along with his political thinking. The examples in the text are both entertaining and informative, and the writing advice is excellent. A good resource people who care about how writing and thinking impact our society."
2858.2."I appreciate what he attempted, but... I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds. It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues. Perhaps to someone researching Lasch himself (who was, admittedly, a renown academic) this material would be interesting, but it isn't in the context of language reference."
2859.1."Unable to install My title says it all.I am running Windows XP with all service packs. AMD Athlon 64X2,4 GB Ram 2 hard drives, tons of free space."
2860.4."Decent, Easy Programability, Lost Points for Durability I guess it is a tribute that I am buying another one of these. I have had this unit for 7 years and it has been slowly dying for a few months. The weakness is the pushbuttons and slide switches that wear out. The real plus to this unit is the interface which is a lot easier and quicker than the almost entirely menu-driven units which take time to change. This one is quick for guests to figure out too. So the ""hard"" buttons are both a strength and weakness. Overall though, a nice thermostat which you may have to replace in a few years--unless the manufacturer has made any changes in it since I bought my original one."
2861.4."Could be even better All good. The only wish I have is that the batteries could be replaced without taking off the whole thing."
2862.5."LUX Programmable Thermostat. Easy to setup. Looks good, great price. Shopped around a bit and this value is second to none. I have only had it for a month or so and good so far."
2863.2."All 3 with unusable LCD screens at night We have 3 of these Lux systems in our sprawling house. All 3 have in a few short years had the LCD screens become unusable at night with the incorporated light. The programming part works well enough, The LCD is ok in a well-lit area, but we need to use a flashlight every time we want to adjust them. Not surprisingly, we adjust them less often. It is very frustrating and seriously compromises and otherwise good product."
2864.5."great product Works well and easy to program. Has definitely decreased our heating bills. Price of product was also very good. Would buy again"
2865.5."Favguti is excellent !! In an age of the internet GUI store fronts, the typical on-line stores may forget the importance of quality in F2F interaction with the customer. In this regards, FAVGUTI exceeds all expectations on customer satisfaction!The product ordered opposed to product recieved was incorrect (...it happens), to final product quality / reliability was addressed daily till mutually satisfied. Need more on-line stores like FAVGUTI !!--Michael (in San Diego)"
2866.2."Irrelevant for some state & women I found this book almost entirely irrelevant and in sore need of update. Nowadays, many states have ""no fault"" divorce (e.g., Colorado), the men's movement has changed culture, and MANY women are career women who are the main bread-winners of the family. This book takes NONE of that effectively into account. Therefore, the book was a total waste of money and time for me. I do not recommend it for any career woman and dedicated mother who is the bread-winner and in a position to need to pay maintenance, lose significant assets, AND lose parenting time despite being BOTH primary parent and primary breadwinner. This book needs to catch up with the times."
2867.4."When you're feeling lost. . . I didn't know where to even begin the divorce/custody process, but this book gave me the confidence to make the first appointment with the lawyer. It helped me not feel like such a ""victim"" and I felt much more knowledgeable and prepared. I didn't feel so much like I was at risk for being ""led by the nose"" by my lawyer, and it was indispensable in helping me stand up to the tactics of my husband. Everyone woman in a divorce situation should read this, especially those with children."
2868.1."What a pity What a pity that a book about a part of India that has received little attention turns out to be so poorly written. A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this."" The author comes across as a naive young woman who did not even know to take toilet paper to a remote part of India and patently she (and her travelling companions) had done little (if any) reading about the history and politics of Assam. This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book."
2869.4.REAL GOSPEL THIS IS THE REAL GOSPEL MUSICTHIS IS WERE IT ALL BEGIN, WHEN GOSPEL MUSICSOUNDED LIKE IT WAS IN CHURCH AND NOT THE CLUBTHIS IS THAT OLD TIME RELIGION ITS GOOD ENOUGHFOR ME
2870.1."Don't waste your time I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money."
2871.3."Okay . . . . I got totally hooked by the first song Tubthumping. I still love that song and break out dancing basically whenever I hear it. Amnesia is an incredible song about a subject I'd never think of. However, as the track numbers got higher, the quality got lower and lower. I like this CD, don't get me wrong, I just think I could have profited by buying the singles instead of the CD."
2872.4."Driving rhythms and biting lyrics make Jack a happy boy. . . When I first heard of this group in Canada, just before their US release, I didn't know what to think. Here was a band of Anarchists, how good could they be? Apparently, very good. I was impressed when I heard the first track with their simple, memorable lyrics that could get a crowd on the floor dancing and singing, and I like Amnesia even more, with it's more otherworldly quality of being just left of center. Their musical style isn't stuck in just one genre, so they are more free to experiment with words and rhythms and to do more diverse things musically without all of us going crazy trying to keep up. All in all a very worthwhile endeavor, definitely a must get."
2873.2."Not worth the money! This c.d. is definitly not what you are expecting. Some of the songs have like 3 different words fpr like five minutes. I definitly don't recomend it."
2874.3."Anarchists Wanna Dance, Too Chumbawamba (whose name does NOT mean ""one hit wonder"" in Swahili) manage to get with the times (or maybe the times caught up with them?) on this album. While ""Tubthumping"" was a deserved hit, ""Amnesia"" probably should've been as well. Nothing on this album is flat-out bad, but several lines don't sing very well, and it's often difficult to tell exactly what's being espoused. Of course, if you just like the driving beat and musical arrangements, forget all that, toss it on and dance around."
2875.3."Some good songs This CD, as far as my personal faves goes, probably gets a 7 out of a 10. This is because, personally, I don't much dig this type of music. Pending my bias, I think that if you like Chumbawumba's 'Tupthumping', you'll like this. Some of the songs on this CD have the ability to get me psyched up and energetic, and I'm practically anemic. 'Mary, Mary' was featured at the beginning of the hit new Patricia Arquette flick, 'Stigmata'. All in all, Chumbawumba's stuff is original and, depending on one's mood, easy and fun to listen to. If you pride yourself in being a despondent dysthymic, though, you might fare better with The Verve or James Horner Soundtracks."
2876.3.Where's the liner notes I'd rather buy the UK version because it has removed (Most) of the liner notes and some lyrics are removed using a bleeping thing
2877.3."The words... I can't say that 'Tubthumper' is a bad CD, however, it's not that good CD, neither. I think that Chumbawamba's style is just not my favorite. I find that the tunes are kinda ""patience-challenging"". However... Chumbawamba's lyrics, filled with political and social criticism, are worth the 12 bucks. The lyrics are REALLY good. They deal with politics, with social problems, religion... I enjoy them a lot. And I actually like bands with ideologies (as long they are not nazi or racist, of course!)We should have much more songwriters like Chumbawamba. Not all lyrics should deal with silly topics like love and stuff. And the tunes are not bad. So I recommend this CD. I think it is in fact closer to 4 stars than to 3 stars (but there's not 3 3/4 stars rating).Well, hope this helps. Take care."
2878.2."Actually 1 stars This CD sends the wrong message (anarchy), and some of it is just plain bizarre. Trust me, you'll tire of it. Save your money and go buy Barenaked Ladies."
2879.2."The only good song is the first track. The only good song is the first track. Unless you can find a single of the first track, save your money. The rest of the CD is trash."
2880.1."The One Star The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually, this song blows after you hear it more than 5 times. This cd has only been in my cd player once...That is the day i bought it. If you like wasting money, buy this cd."
2881.5."The ""goods"" make the ""bads"" look utterly insignificant! A+! Granted, most of the songs on this album are decent, but not great. However, the four songs that ARE great (Tubthumping, etc.) are so incredible that they literally blow the rest of the songs away! It is worth paying twice the price just to hear one of these amazing four songs!"
2882.5."HAPPY, SHINY ANARCHY'S NEVER BEEN MORE FUN! While Chumbawamba's recent musical efforts have left little or no impression on the music scene, their debut album ""TUBTHUMPER"" will remain ""thumping"" to the dance club beat of a different drum. For unexplainable reasons, I find myself coming back to this album time and time again. The music will not let you go. It's enjoyable, entertaining, and fun!""Tubthumping"" is an unrellenting statement of defiance. ""Amnesia""'s persistent guitar riff and catchy trumpets will NOT leave you suffering from ""long term memory loss"". ""The Big Issue"" contains some tatalizing chorale, and a catchy, lyrical tune. ""Mary, Mary"" is probably my favorite questioning the sanctity of Catholicism.Chambawamba may come and go, but let this be known. There was a band with a wierd name from England, whose music was fun to listen to, coherant, and made anarchy seem like fun!God Save ""Tubthumper""!"
2883.4."Great music, great anarchy Damn, their still selling this CD? Well, my friend gave it to me a couple years ago. I liked Tubthimping and all, although I wasn't crazy about it. Actually, it's not the only good song on the CD, Amnesia, Drip, The Big Issue, and Scapegoat are all awsome songs, as are most others. Some of the songs never really caught onto me, but most of it is good music. Anarchy rules!"
2884.2."Where's the variety? It may have some, but not much. Tubthumping gets boring after listening to it about 5 times. Amnesia is the best, but that song is OK."
2885.5."Fast and loud, that's how I like it. Even though Chumbawamba's most popular single in America was Tubthumping, that is my least favorite song on this album. It's way too slow. The rest of the songs are really fast, and have a great beat. If you like music with a beat, you must get this CD! Hey, even better, many of Chumbawamba's songs actually have meaning, for those of you that have a brain. There are a total of 12 songs and about ten mini-songs on the CD"
2886.2."In the words of Dr. Evil, ""riiiiiiiiiiiigggggghhhhhht"" I'll be the first one to sadly admit, I bought this album only having heard ""Tubthumping"". That was a huge mistake. If you're considering buying this album only because of that, please DON'T! ""Tubthumping"" gets old after a while anyways. The rest of this CD is hardly worth listening to. There are some mediocre songs here and there, but trust me, this is not worth your [money]."
2887.3."tubthumping This is the weirdest cd I have ever listened to. I don't know what it's called but it's to make the song longer. That's cool! At the end of ""Amnesia"", you hear a lady come on talking about brains; ""scoop the brains out, blast the brains with water or air..."" The first time I heard it, I thought it was really weird and unusual. I was disgusted by it and changed rthe song. Now I think it's cool. How they put bits and pieces of random stuff in the songs. Cool. They don't do that with all 12 songs. I also like the music in ""Scapegoat."""
2888.1."Icky lyrics! Tubthumber was the reason I wanted this cd and I got it. About 1,000,000 times on the radio plus 100 on the cd. Now I can't stand Tubthumper.The lyrics and music keep repeating themselves. All the other songs have bad lyrics that are negative too! This was not the best choice for me."
2889.1."STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD!! This CD is pure crap. The songs are pitiful and shaky. Your money would be better spent on ANYTHING else besides this cd."
2890.1."AAAARRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!! Minus ""Tubthumping"", listening to this album is equal to putting your head in the frig. and slamming the door! Avoid the hype. Not even good dance music."
2891.1."Blech! I used to not be a fan of modern music - this Cd almost turned me off modern music completely (it was a gift from a friend.) There is one good song on it: ""Tubthumping"" (I didn't know that was the name; I thought the name was ""I get Knocked Down."") Anyhow, that is the only good song. The rest are bad (except for ""good ship lifestyle,"" which is okay.) The good part about the Cd is if I turn it on, my sisters step out of my room almost instantly. So, if you're looking for a way to disturb the peace, this is it."
2892.1."uhm, why was this popular? Is there anything less than one star? This might be the worst CD I have ever listened to. One of my friends bought it used, shortly after it came out. Note that fact for future reference: if it just came out, and people are already selling it used, it SUCKED. The lyrics are positively nonsensical, and there is nothing creative or interesting in the instrumentation, melodies, etc. There's one song where all they say is ""drip drip drip goes the water."" What the heck is that supposed to mean? More like, drip, drip, drip melts the plastic, since I left this in the trunk of my car."
2893.3."topper These work very well if the item is exactally the same size. If what you are covering is smaller it just sits on top, if bigger it doesn't streatch enough"
2894.4."Easy and reliable I have had this printer for approximately four years and have had absolutely NO problems with it. It is dependable and reliable. Very efficient. I would recommend it!"
2895.2."Not recommended We have had this printer about 3 weeks and the cartridge already needs replaced. We do not do an excessive amount of printing, so I think that is a little too soon to run out of ink.Also this printer jams up very easily (one of the reasons I was replacing the last HP printer I had) I feel I have spent as much time fixing paper jams as I have printing. It is easy to fix when it does jam up, but a little frustrating that it happens so often.The print quality is good (just make sure you have the paper settings set correctly to the type of paper you are using!) and it does print quietly and is easy to operate. But overall I would not recommend it."
2896.1."Not a very good printer Lasted six months. Never worked exactly right since I purchased it. I think it had software driver problems. Would work sporadically, then lock up and paper have to be cleared manually. Final straw, no matter what type paper it was fed, it would catch in the feed path underneath the print head for no apparent reason. Of course the paper still keeps trying to feed, so the machine just wads it into a mess. In addition to the software driver problem, I think it has a significant design problem with the paper feed as it often trys to feed up to five or six sheets at once, even the HP desk jet paper designed for such printers. I will say that when it did work, it printed well."
2897.2."Limited life span My 940C lasted five years, but ate up its paper drive mechanism yesterday.The prints were very good, although color quality was sometimes off.Hard to complain when it came free with the Mac, but it is a slow printer and with amulti-color ink cartridge, somewhat more expensive than a printer using more individual cartridges.Always had minor paper feeding glitches."
2898.1."NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER!! I spent over 2 1/2 hrs. (after 1 hr. myself) on the phone with HP trying to install this printer. It never would work right. The HP tech said there is a problem in the software program of this printer. This HP DESKJET 940C is everyone's worst installation nightmare!"
2899.4."Excellent! I just ordered another one! Printer was exactly as I expected, practically new condition and worked perfectly. It was shipped quickly and I am very satisfied. In fact, I just ordered another from Solar. I think it was the last refurbished one they had. Sorry."
2900.2."Don't Go There Despite the great rating and rave reviews, I curse the day I brought this one home. I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer--not because I am so productive, but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject. Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in ""that's a common problem. The arm doesn't detract after each page. You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens."" So far, that means 6-8 times per day. No more HP for me! This is my second bad experience. You would think I would have learned by now."
2901.2."Buyer Beware I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects. The printer shredded 40% of the print jobs I sent. The roller jams the paper in back, forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster. It is like playing toy-tug with my dog. If it does not eat your print jobs, then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast. I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership"
2902.3."Overall, a B+ I've had the 940c for a couple of years and use it at my work. I print 20 to 30 documents a day, mostly b&w; but some color also.Overall this is a good printer and does its job nicely. What this printer lacks in features it makes up for in ease of use and consistency. Rarely have I ever had a paper jam but when I have it's easy to resolve."
2903.3."Got problems, but its a good printer I got this after my OLD hp printer finally died. The quality is good, but it is extremely slow. Took 2 hours to print a screenshot from Unreal 2 at best quality. Its possibly because I'm using the parallel port, not the USB. As the printer DID NOT come with a USB cable. Also, NEVER USE THE CANCEL BUTTON ON IT!!!! It sends a strange message to the comp. which the computer sends back to the printer and tells it to print from 20-80 pages of JIBBERISH. Also it is a MEMORY HOG ON YOUR PC!!! I HAD TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO FOR 2 HOURS!! But i must admit, the quality is excellent. On the included sample of photo quality paper, it looks fantastic.So if you buy this printer, buy a USB cable and have a lot of memory. Also if you set it to the max resoultion for printing, it requires 400 mb. of extra hard drive space.So the choice is yours. If you buy it and don't like it, don't say i didn't warn you..."
2904.5."So far sooooooo good I bought this printer two weeks ago and had it up and running within minutes of unpacking. When I first bought this PC I feared the two most commonly documented problems,paper jams and printer driver problems/OS problems, but to date I have not experienced either and the quality is as good as the laser printers I use in the office. The only thing I dislike about this printer is the high cost of replacement cartridges so I am hoping someone will deveolpe a refill kit similiar to the one I used with my old Canon BJC 250, which worked great..."
2905.3."Good Printer This printer lasted more then 2 years. Perfect prtints, and not a ink hog. But we bought cheaper ink and it caused the ink to drip or drag from the paper to the rollers of the printer. So if you do buy, make sure you only use HP ink. Dont listen to the sales guy at Frys like we did!!!!!"
2906.2."It worked fine until I bought a new computer I owned this printer for more than a year. It worked fine until I bought a new computer, I unplugged it, moved to a new place, and replugged it. The power supply burnt out. The printer was dead. I wasted 2 packs of unused expensive ink cartridges."
2907.1."A poor use of my money I bought a new laptop and wanted a new printer. This wone came highly recommended from the story. It worked great for three months (of course, the length of the warranty). It now only states ""paper jam"" and after hours of time on the phone and with the hints on the web, I am going out to buy a new printer - I would certainly not buy this one, again."
2908.2."Loved it, then it left me... This is the 3rd HP printer I have owned and it has broken the fastest. My first one was around for four years of college, then it died. The second, an 820 Cse lasted about 18 months. The 940c lasted me just over a year and died. Add to this the fact that the cartridges are expensive (I'm stuck with 6 of them) and don't last terribly long.I'm thinking laser to replace this one, and a Canon inkjet for color printing."
2909.2."HP 940C After using this printer for one year (home use), a plastic bracket to which a spring attaches to maintain belt tension on the print cartridge carriage broke. Rather than try to get a new part, I'm going to throw this printer away and buy a new one."
2910.2."I won't buy one again I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in ""best"" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!"
2911.1."Bad printer Do not buy this printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it- it jams every other time I print, and most of the time, it grabs 3-4 papers at once, and prints on all of them. I certainly expected better quality from HP, and this did not deliver. The printing is decent when it works, which is not often. I will be looking for a different company next time."
2912.2."worked great until it just STOPPED working at all! I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out. I thought I was ""movin' up"" by purchasing an HP, well, this one stopped working after 6 months: the printer carriage gets hung up on the right. I went to the website for troubleshooting options, none of which solved the problem....and the warranty is the biggest weakness...90-days! This alone speaks poorly of the expectations HP has of its own products. EPSON's warranty was 1 YEAR, but I had misplaced the receipt. SO, perhaps EPSON is a better deal, as long as you KEEP THE RECEIPT!"
2913.4."Decent Inkjet I've had the HP940c for a year now with no problems. The printer installed via USB under Windows XP without a hitch. Photos and text are good quality. I have used multiple pages/page printing and manual duplexing without any hicups. No jams to date. Replacement of catridges is easy. Low cartrides are noted by a dialog box popping up and by lifting the lid to the catridges to see where the cartridges line up with the icons inside the printer. Replacement catridges are expensive, but this printer scored well vs other inkjets in cost/page on PC Magazine's review. I use a HP Laserjet 1200 for volume printing where color is not critical. Good bang for the buck. To get 5 stars, the printer would need to be faster, hold more paper and cost less for cartridge replacement. You just won't get that at this price range."
2914.4."Shadow in the Glass It is always a pleasant suprise when a new author appears on the fantasy scene with a book that should keep them there for a long time. Shadow in the Glass has a great blend of magic and adventure, which has nicely set up the series for the next three books."
2915.2."Curved Thomas the Train tracks Again, a good product, but over priced. I would try to find some gently used ones."
2916.3."Kinda dull rock, but part of my first exposure to Schweisser I picked this up (and 'Autobahn zur Holle') based on some reviews that made them sound like a German AC/DC or perhaps, even better: 'Megaherz'. The album opens with the title track 'Heiland' which is probably my favorite. Track one has the meter and aggression of a mid-paced AC/DC tune and appears to be as fast and vigorous as die Schweißer care to play. From there each track is progressively a little mellower than the previous. While I'm sure this album would appeal to someone, it seems that those who like the mellower end of it would probably prefer something by the 'Puhdys', and those looking for something harder would prefer 'Megaherz'."
2917.5."Quilts from the Smithsonian I'm a quilt lover, and my favorite are old scrappy quilts. I do alot of quilting myself, but as a result of my love for quilts I also collect quilt books. One of my favorites is this little books from That Patchwork Place, Quilts from the Smithsonian by Mimi DietrichThe book has pictures and patterns of 12 great quilts from the Smithsonian collection, from a simple Plaid Patch to the more complexed Chesapeake Rose, and The Lilies of the Quilters. There are all colored pictures all through the book, and the there are easy to follow directions helping you to make your own quilts for future generations to love. Or if you are not a quilter the book si a perfect coffee table book with all it's colors and inspirations.Britt Arnhild Lindland"
2918.3."Baptists from the days of Jesus to now.. It is the exact thing I was expecting and serves my requirement for research.The book is precise and gives the source for his facts."
2919.1."I will stick with the pink or blue packets... Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a ""sandy grit"" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body."
2920.2."Worse than Stevia. Mild sweeetness - though ultimately tastes like soap - or something reminiscent of soap."
2921.3."Mounting Brackets a Problem The description says ""Mounting brackets...are included where applicable"", evidently Edelmann considers the two mounting brackets on this line as re-useable. The OEM brackets are spot-welded together, you cannot remove them from the old line until you drill out the spot weld. I tried a chisel to separate the halves, but that only butchered the bracket. Being a weekend mechanic I was not prepared to have to re-use those brackets. I checked some other stores, none of them included a bracket either. This hose assembly is of good quality, it fit just fine, the price and delivery were great, but I was upset because I was unprepared and not knowledgeable about how to remove and re-use the existing brackets."
2922.4."Great little treasures We have a colletion of Little Critter books that my 3 older ones have enjoyed since they were little. Now with my 2 younger ones I purchased a few new ones. They sure love them! They're simple books but they are a hit!"
2923.5."Your Signature Life by Dianna Booher Personal accountability, integrity, character - whatever you label it, it's doing the right thing, even when no one else is watching. ""Your Signature Life"" is a personal-development home run!Through captivating imagery and intriguing statistics, Dianna Booher challenges us to examine our lives to see what kind of character we are developing. Do we reflect light or darkness? She shows us how our experiences and relationships may help to form the way we look at the world, but they do not have to define who we are or who we will become.Although we cannot control the actions of those around us, we are called to control our responses to those actions. Personal accountability is not a thing of the past. We can and must have it today if we ever hope to look back over our lives and smile. Others are watching. God is watching.Ms. Booher's latest release, ""Your Signature Life,"" is a triumph for those seeking to live a life of integrity and total fulfillment."
2924.4."Asimov's early work his best The best example around of Asimov's work. It is intellectual, interesting, and just plain entertaining. reading it, you can feel the danger that the fledgeling Foundation is in when threatened by its aggeressive neighbors and there are unconventional solutions. I have only two complaints. The book is dated and there is little action. Get past those and you're sure to enjoy the book."
2925.1."I almost read the whole thing!!! 50,000 years in the future and they are still smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers, the main power source is nuclear energy..and they carry nuclear guns??? A kid in the 2nd grade has more imagination!I almost made it to the end. It had gotten so absurd that it finally just drifted off to a shelf....What I didn't like:1) Lack of imagination (see above).2) Cardboard characters. Nobody to really cheer for..either the character is a pencil necked geek or some babbling fool.3) False religion mumbo jumbo: never would of worked IF most/allthe priests new it was a farce.Avoid unless you need something to stoke the fire with next winter."
2926.1."B-O-R-I-N-G This has to be one of the worst books i EVER picked up. Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"
2927.1."Waste of time;Stick to Robot novels. This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."
2928.2."Melodramatic pulp Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices. The book (and its successors) read like an episode of Leave It to Beaver set in outer space. The repetitive vault openings became tediously predictable - I felt like I had read the same chapter a dozen times. Read the Cliff Notes, save yourself some time. *****"
2929.2."Wonderful book, except for the part with all the words. The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from ""Foundation"" to ""How Not to Write a Book"" or ""Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English."" I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."
2930.3."Foundation The main reason I read sci-fi is to visualize strange new worlds and places. Although a good book, I didn't really get a good mental picture of the different worlds involved in it except Trantor in the very beginning of the book. It was mostly about people and politics with very little of the landscapes they lived in. I guess that is why I liked the Dune and Hyperion series so much."
2931.2."Disappointing I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way."
2932.4."Smart, Sporadically very Engaging Parts of the book I really enjoyed. I appreciate the twists played by characters on one another. I felt that after reading through the entire bit, though, that not enough had actually taken place. I didn't feel I walked away with a story I could remember. I did read in one review that this was ""serious science fiction,"" so with that in mind, I still give it five stars. I only would have liked that the pace be quicker.I really really enjoyedThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I would recommend that over this book Foundation, based on my personal taste."
2933.4."Classic mind-stretching sci-fi This is certainly an excellent ""first"" book in the Asimov series. Even if one has not read, Prelude to Foundation, you can pick up right up and enjoy the series. Sets the stage for the next books in the series, but also makes one think, ""What would happen if America lost its power sources?"""
2934.4."The first written, and the worst of the series I started reading this series with the original ""Foundation"" and was very disappointed with it. After all the acclaim it received, I was expecting something truly exceptional. Instead, I got a historical narrative that is closer in style to something you would read in the Brittanica for a school assignment. It is really a kind of ""mutant"" between a novel and a documentary. What's more, it is exceptionally boring. What kept me going was the Asimov name on the cover and the hope of better things to come. This is not to say that it is a really bad book. I must confess that it has some interesting parts and of course, the series as a whole is an absolute classic. Every other novel in the Foundation series is so brilliant, that they cover for this disappointment. It must also be remembered that Asimov wrote this book in the early 50's when he was still a young and inexperienced writer"
2935.3."Romans in Space I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk, Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style, I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum, a good book if you can ignore this stuff."
2936.4."Still good science fiction, even for 1951 Foundation is great science fiction for the scientific minded, no deus ex machina here. The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm, cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills, you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter, every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing, like Hemmingway, there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book, but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots."
2937.1."zzzzzz..... I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."
2938.3."Psychohistory Saves Classic Re-reading Foundation showed it to be rather dated in its depiction of an advanced galactic empire, rooted in its 1940s science fiction environment. The overall plot, such as it is, betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories, and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire, the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy, is a much better novel, especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However, the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe."
2939.4."A filler A trilogy consists of three books so, even although ""Foundation"" (one of the true classics) is good enough to be a trilogy by itself, formally ""Foundation"" needed two more volumes to make up a trilogy. In these two volumes the level does not fall off too badly, although ""the Mule"" is rather weak.Unfortunately Asimov, one of the truly greats of SF, later succumbed to undue pressure and combined his Robot-series (already in itself continued too long) with the Foundation, with outright embarrassing results. The original three books were quite enough, thank you!"
2940.4."Not Free SF Reader The start of Asimov's highly influential groundbreaking future history series. The invention of the science of psychohistory captivated me the first time I read it. Basically, all those with an interest in SF should check this out.Asimov's intro gives some history of the evolution of this series with his editor, Campbell, as well as some entertaining silliness by the publisher Doubleday. He tells how they wouldn't publish him at one time, and later on they are at his door, cap in hand asking for a new book.Foundation : The Psychohistorians - Isaac AsimovFoundation : The Encyclopedists - Isaac AsimovFoundation : The Mayors - Isaac AsimovFoundation : The Traders - Isaac AsimovFoundation : The Merchant Princes - Isaac AsimovFuture prediction equations suggest Galactic Empire go bye-bye.4.5 out of 5Struggles with Seldon's legacy.3 out of 5City split and the odd ship.3.5 out of 5Commercial leading edge.3 out of 5Seldon crisis and sellers of heaps of stuff.3.5 out of 5"
2941.4."Good? You bet. Great? Not sure ... I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin."
2942.2."Bor-ring! I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme."
2943.2."what masterpiece? This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."
2944.1."This is a cult book... ... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it. The characters are flat, the story is contrived, and why are all people of power in this world men? Very realistic idea of the future."
2945.5."Never gets old Having just finished Greg Bear's brilliant ""Foundation & Chaos"", I've decided I can no longer wait to begin re-reading the original again. I wish I could take the next few months to start off with the Robot series, move on to the Galactic Empire series, and then finsh with the entire collection of the Foundation books (because it's all one big wunnerful story, doncha' know!). Well, not this year, perhaps, but in a few I may do just that. In the meantime, I will re-read ""Foundation"" with yet another new perspective of Hari Seldon and all that came before this original masterpiece... it truly never gets old."
2946.1."Text to speech disabled = no sale I read this book as a teenager and was excited to be reminded of it recently. I went to Amazon to purchase the book to find that it is one without text to speech enabled.I make it my policy not to buy any book that doesn't have this feature as I prefer to read when I'm stationary and listen while I'm driving. Since the future isn't here yet and I can't safely read while I'm driving, this is a problem for me.Listen up publishers. I'm not going to buy your audio book. Disabling this feature just ensures that I'll not buy your ebook either. If I really want to read this book, I'll find a used copy because you've annoyed me that much."
2947.1."No Canadians allowed... WTF! Copyright restrictions make it so I cannot get this classic on my kindle... Its a kindle, I should be able to get any book in any language sent to me in any part of the world. I hate you Johnny Copyright!"
2948.1."ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....Is it over yet? Count me with the minority who found this book unreadable. It was incredibly dated with imagery very thin and sparse. I got lost in the pointless dialog and was unable to finish."
2949.1."Didn't Believe a Word of It I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."
2950.1."One of the worst things I've ever read This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse."
2951.3."Be Careful of the Edition Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science fiction minds of the twentieth century. He was NOT, however, a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.""Foundation,"" the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series, is a collection of short stories originally published in ""Astounding"" magazine. The first couple are very good, but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven, dialogue is unrealistic, and characters are wooden and one-dimensional. And yet, through Asimov's wonderfully creative idea of psychohistory and its use in saving a dying Galactic Empire, this series became one of the best science fiction stories of all time, and well worth reading.Do be careful which edition you read. I read the Del Ray paperback edition, and I have never seen so many typographical errors in a published book."
2952.5."Tapes were as advertise The set arrived on time and enjoyed listening to the tapes, the tapes arrived in good condition and great sound."
2953.5."Foundation Great book by Isaac Asimov. What a wonderful sci fi book. I'd recommend this series for anyone that likes fiction"
2954.5."It Holds up Not earth shaking or intensely mind bending but even after 30 years I enjoyed rereading the series. Asimov's storytelling is great!"
2955.5."Smart. Thought provoking. Classic. Sci-fi at its best! Asimov was one of the founding fathers of Sci-fi and to him we owe a debt of gratitude for making the genre worthy of the literary title. His messages and considerations give the reader a lot more than just something to kill time. It makes sci-fi an avenue to real soul searching."
2956.5."OUTSTANDING a must read and re-read (by ISAAC ASIMOV) Any coment's on this serie of books must be a positive one and if it's not then thats becouse you dident understand the story, so you should reread them all again, i stronly recommend this serie of books to anyone, not just sci fans, but to all that have the taste to read. The author of this serie wrote 470 books, he was a genius and died out of his time with the age of 72, in memory of ISAAC ASIMOV i recommend all of his books, but especially the foundation series,thaks for reading my review."
2957.5."The Zenith of Asimov! I highly recommend the time to read ""Foundation""...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"
2958.5."great read The book doesn't really need yet another enthusiastic review, so I'll keep this to the point.The stories in this book are really enjoyable. You get to learn about characters in the beginning and then spend the rest of the time reading about the legacy they created and the later events that they had a hand in shaping. I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read, the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down."
2959.2."Confused about ""classic"" status Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. ""Nuclear"" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!"
2960.1."Piece of crap from crap seller I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. What's worse, it's in absolutely terrible shape. The front cover is ripped, the spine has old sticker residue on it, and the back looks like it's been chewed on by a small animal. So much for being ""Used- Very Good Condition"""
2961.4."Good Book I enjoyed the Foundation. The book is divided into 5 parts. The most interesting of the 5 is the 3rd one. The end is not what i expected. The 5 parts overall are not particularly conected in my opinion. But the book was good."
2962.3."over all a pretty good book FOundation was not the most enjooyable book i have ever read. My biggest compalaint was the time gap were too big. I think the book went over to long a time. One mintue your on one planet with these charecters and the next chapter everone is dead and its been 50 years"
2963.2."Well, it's Asimov This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."
2964.3."A classic ... good thing it's short. Let's face it: Isaac Asimov was not a very good writer, especially this early in the game. We read 'Foundation' not because we are interested in reading some fantastic literature but because the ideas in this little book became the tropes that have thrived in science fiction even to this day. If you're interested in sci-fi, 'Foundation' is a must-read.The importance of 'Foundation' in the genre may force us to allow for the blandness of its prose; however, it does not excuse it. The characters are ciphers, the style is blunt and ugly, like a sledgehammer, and there are plenty of minor but annoying infelicities of grammar. It's a good thing the novel is pleasantly short; whatever Asimov's faults, long-windedness was not one of them."
2965.3."A pleasant book for a beginning reader, not much else... I read this book as a teenager, and loved it. Read it again several years later, and could not understand what it was that I liked. Sure, Asimov writes with ease - and it is equally easy to read. But the characters are totally flat, the plot (?if any) is thoroughly predictable, and he also shows a terrible amount of prejudice against women, minority people and just about anything that does not fit the template of ""middle-age white american male"". The book generally left a bad taste, as if you'd stuffed yourself on marshmallows - mostly air but enough sugar to make you feel sick."
2966.3."just lost interest 3/4 way through previous reviewers hit on the my main gripes. no character development or insights. predictable plot development. no women at all. i understand it was written as a series of shorts, but it is really just a political drama played out in space. it could just as easily been set on earth in any era. some interesting moments, but far from gripping.i much preferred early heinlein, clarke, and later ellison, pangborn, farmer, pohl, cordwainer smith, et al.dont think i'll bother with the rest of the series."
2967.2."Dry Sci-Fi I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this."
2968.3."Pleasant SF outing, but little more. Three stars is a bit generous, but this certainly isn't a bad book. In fact, it is easy to read, always interesting, and often exciting. But that's all it is. It is not deep or meaingful. It is not profoud. It is not thought provoking. It isn't even particularly well written. But it's so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching collapse of civilization. This is an interesting enough premise and very original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take seriously.If you come across a copy of this book, read it. It won't take long and you'll probably enjoy much of it even if your not a SF fan, but I don't recommend anyone by this book. There is to much out there that is much much better."
2969.4."Ahead Of His Time. The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time."
2970.5."Excellent, but it now! I admit it, I am an Asimov-phile. This is yet another book by Asimov that is very hard to put down. I rate this, and all of Asimovs books with the highest regard. Quite simply buy it now, or you are a fool. ;-)"
2971.4."Excellent unless you are looking for Star Wars This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment."
2972.3."A classic appropriate for scifi newcomers & series lovers First, I read quite a bit from all genres, primarily to expand my world. Foundation is a very good series, but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world: 1) you were a statistics/religion/philosophy major in college (it may annoy); 2) you want a book for entertainment, not to ponder (it may bore); 3) you really think character development is important in a book (it spans generations, hence little/no development); 4) You're already a scifi buff (most of the books you've read have already assimilated the ideas of Foundation -- credit where due!). Biggest reason to read: its robust, well-crafted universe. Other tidbits: I've tried to read this series a second time, but it can't sustain my interest quite like other 5-star selections."
2973.5."Always liked Asimov I always liked Asimov, but finding series books in sequence is difficult with print books. Kindle makes it easy! Now they're all cataloged in order and I don't even have to get out of bed for the next one.Reading the ""Foundation"" series in order rather than by availability makes a great writer even better."
2974.3."Great Idea amatuer writing Foundation is completely a story of ideas, the characters are completely servants to the scifi galaxy Asimov has created. The story is of a galaxy in a situation and not a character in a situation. I think the idea he created was amazing but I prefer stories about characters and because he originally wrote the stories for a magazine and later combined them which destroyed the flow of the storyRich"
2975.3."Good, but not the best I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever. It was good, but not that great. Maybe in the 1950's it was the best of sci-fi, but compared to today's standards it was a little boring and out of date. It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future. There's not a lot of action but I have to admit the dialog is pretty good. If you're into nostalgia, politics and interesting dialog this book is for you."
2976.5."Best Book by Asimov (fiction) I have read almost all of Asimov's fiction, and this book is by far one of the best. I would recommend it to anyone interested!Boom, Done.-Jeremy Paul Gallagher"
2977.5."One of the best ever This book it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever written. It should be on the ""must read"" list for any sci-fi fan."
2978.2."Don't Bother Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However, you should stop there. Foundation is bad. This book is totally predictable. Read DUNE if you want something intelligent and entertaining. Read FOUNDATION if you want something that you probably won't even finish."
2979.5."Wonderful What can I say??? Asimov at his best. It's impossible to stop reading this book. The chapters are so incredible, that you can't wait to get to the finish to know how the plot ends. If you haven't read it, you don't know what you are missing"
2980.5."Cornerstone of Science Fiction Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best, this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival, for this planet, Terminus, holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it."
2981.3."Good, but not as good as Foundation Foundation and Empire is basically a continuation of Foundation. There really isn't a new plot, just new problems for the Foundation to deal with. Foundation and Empire is pretty good, but without the novelty of the new ideas presented in Foundation, it is a bit flat. About the only reason I could think of to recommend this book is so you can see what else happens to Seldon's colony."
2982.1."Still hasn`t arrived after two months The book was apparently resent after not arriving 5 weeks after ordering and it still hasnt arrived after two months. phshopus customer service has been responsive but there is something going wrong with the shipment process"
2983.4."Foundational series! If this series seems a little dated and naive now, try to cut yourself back to when it was read! I appreciated the imaginative leaps, as well as the way the whole series observes the discipline of the genre -- make one fundamental alteration to science as we know it, and then see where the thread leads you."
2984.5."Classic science fiction I remember walking to the library as a thirteen year old with my back pack, smile on my face between each of the foundation books. Now, I have read them over again (a few times) and the only difference is that I now own them so no more walks to the library."
2985.4."Foundation Series It was a very interesting concept, a bit heavy on a scientific version of ""fate"". This series of books uses the concept of random motion as a prediction for the future was quite a brilliant idea. The story deals with a genius who predicts behavior for millenia into the future and actually has recorded holograms for future people that deal with his predictions. Where I had trouble was the reliance on robots in the later books. I personally prefer the human side of things. It was an interesting read and well worth it."
2986.3."Classic but drifting, give it a second chance In my initial read of this book, I stuck with it because it is a classic and everyone loves it. However, after about half of the book I got bored, nothing seemed to be building or catching, so I stopped. I have restarted and am more interested now because I know some more of the background story. So far, the second trip through this book is much more enjoyable than my first slow trip."
2987.2."tough going I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"
2988.3."The Softest of Soft Sci Fi I read this* because it presents a galaxy without aliens, colonized by people. It was soft SF in so many ways (incl. FTL, antigravity, flying cars, walnut-sized nuclear reactors, laser pistols, personal and city force shields, egregious use of energy in the form of anti-gravity elevators) and the psychohistorian-predicts-future-events-to-the-day plot was dumb--not to mention the idea of civilizations with FTL ships incapable of harnessing nuclear power. With repeated suspensions of disbelief, it was pleasant enough. The characters were not such nitwits as those of ""Prelude to Fdn."" No need to read his other books.* after reading If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens...Where is Everybody?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life (2002) by Stephen Webb"
2989.2."letdown after the first book I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book. The two stories lacked charters that I cared about and unlike the first foundation book their was very little to contemplate. Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page."
2990.3."A good story, but somewhat weak on characters This may be a classic and I may be a science fiction fan, but read Asimov's ""The Gods Themselves"" instead of this. His later work is definitely better. ""Foundation and Empire"" is like its predecessor (""Foundation"") in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff, but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading, ""Why am I reading this?"" I'll read the last in the trilogy (""Second Foundation""), but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi, read ""Hyperion,"" ""Fall of Hyperion,"" ""Ender's Game,"" ""Childhood's End"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.""For good sci-fi, read ""More Than Human,"" ""The Gods Themselves,"" ""Slan,"" ""The Demolished Man,"" ""The Stars My Destination.""TOO MUCH TO LIST, MY FRIENDS!!!Good luck and good reading."
2991.4."Department of Morbid Details In a twisted (mis)reading of the Foundation series, the Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo used Asimov's epic as a prophecy of upcoming apocalypse and converted dimsighted guru-dictator Shoko Ashara into an incarnation of Hari Seldon. Worthwhile to sharpen your wits as you read the story to see how the zealots got it wrong -- but also how they could easily pervert Asimov's points. (See David Kaplan and Andrew Marshall's book, ""The Cult at the End of the World."")"
2992.4."Foundation By Isaac Asimov I always enjoy reading Isaac Asimov's writing, and foundation was no exception. The plot is imaginative and original, like much of Asimov's writing. Foundation is set in the future, a time when our galaxy is ruled by a failing empire. Hari seldon, a psychologist, must prevent the galaxy from falling into anarchy and barbarism by creating a foundation of scientists. Foundation is fun to read, and provides ample entertainment. I recommend reading it."
2993.2."Just not my kind of book - Others liked it. It isn't my kind of book but, I thought, I would give it a try. We read it in our book club. Some of the readers liked it, most of them didn't. I didn't. But, the author did have great insight to the future in the 1950 - 1960's"
2994.1."A very bad book ...To my surprise and disappointment, I found ""Foundation"" to be an exceptionally terrible ""book"", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged ""novel"" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ..."
2995.1."An Example of What is ""Classically"" Wrong with SciFi. I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."
2996.1."Do not buy this HP 960 printer from ANTonline This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon. After paying the advertized price of $61.97 plus $22.82 shipping and handling charge, they sent and delivered you a 6 oz size bubble wrapped pack Innovera Solid ink sticks/cartridge.No invoice or phone number in the package!"
2997.3."color ink cartridge I've had this printer for about a year. About every 3 months I need to change the color ink cartridge when I don't even use it. I've called support and they didn't help me at all. I changed the black ink and when I print something, nothing comes out on the paper. On the printer it shows 3 circles on top and 4 on the bottom. I can't keep buying color ink cartriges every 3 months. What do I need to do?"
2998.2."Good printer, so so on photos, crap for envelopes. I have just spent 5 minutes trying to get this damn printer to print an envelope without mangling it. Wonderful."
2999.3."Ne Ver, Ne Boisia... I love t.A.T.u and I have done several t.A.T.u reviews.I bought this CD merely for the fact I loved Ne Ver, Ne Boisia from the Eurovision.Not Gonna Get Us (Radio Edit) was okay, not the best of the t.A.T.u tracks (I prefered the Album Version to the Edit) and the All The Things She Said Remix was passable.This CD isn't much use now I have the Special Edition 200km/h In The Wrong Lane album. However it is still good on the whole."
